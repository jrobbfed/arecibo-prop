Our search for pulsars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies will address three main science goals:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The discovery or a pulsar in a UFD would be the \textbf{first known extragalactic pulsar outside of the Magellanic Clouds}.
\item Placing observational limits on the pulsar population in UFDs will provide the first \textbf{constraint on the high-mass initial mass function} (IMF) of the oldest dynamically unevolved stellar populations.
\item By measuring the dispersion of the pulses from a pulsar in a UFD, we \textbf{probe the electron density of the intergalactic medium} towards that line of sight.
\end{enumerate}
We justify each of these goals in turn.
