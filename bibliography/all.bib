	Abstract = {The recent discovery of a 2 M&sun; binary millisecond pulsar not only has important consequences for the equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities but also raises the interesting question of whether the neutron star PSR J1614-2230 was born massive. The answer is vital for understanding neutron star formation in core collapse supernovae. Furthermore, this system raises interesting issues about the nature of the progenitor binary and how it evolved during its mass-exchanging X-ray phase. In this paper we discuss the progenitor evolution of PSR J1614-2230. We have performed detailed stellar evolution modelling of intermediate-mass X-ray binaries undergoing Case A Roche lobe overflow (RLO) and applied an analytic parametrization for calculating the outcome of either a common envelope evolution or the highly super-Eddington isotropic re-emission mode. We find two viable possibilities for the formation of the PSR J1614-2230 system: either it contained a 2.2-2.6 M&sun; giant donor star and evolved through a common envelope and spiral-in phase or, more likely, it descended from a close binary system with a 4.0-5.0 M&sun; main-sequence donor star via Case A RLO. We conclude that the neutron star must have been born with a mass of either ˜1.95 M&sun; or 1.7 $\pm$ 0.15 M&sun;, which significantly exceeds neutron star birth masses in previously discovered radio pulsar systems. Based on the expected neutron star birth masses from considerations of stellar evolution and explosion models, we find it likely that the progenitor star of PSR J1614-2230 was more massive than 20 M&sun;.},

	Abstract = {Recent mass measurements of two binary millisecond pulsars, PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0751+1807 with a mass M=1.97+/-0.04 Msun and M=1.26+/-0.14 Msun respectively indicate a large span of masses for such objects, and possibly also a broad spectrum of neutron star masses born in core-collapse supernovae. Starting from a zero-age main sequence binary stage, we aim at inferring the masses of the progenitor neutron star of PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0751+1807 by taking into account the differences in the evolutionary stages preceding their formation. Using simulations for the evolution of binary stars we reconstruct the evolutionary tracks leading to the formation of PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0751+1807. We analyse in detail the spin evolution due to the accretion of matter from a disk in the medium-mass/low-mass X-ray binary. General relativistic effects and the damping of surface magnetic field associated with accretion are accounted for. We consider two equations of state of dense matter, one for purely nucleonic matter and the other one including a high density softening due to the appearance of hyperons, together with a selection of models for the neutron star magnetic field and its decay. The estimated mass of the progenitor neutron stars of PSR J0751+1807 and PSR J1614-2230 could be as small as 1.1 Msun and 1.9 Msun, respectively. These values weakly depend on the equation of state and the assumed model for the polar magnetic field and its accretion-induced decay. The masses of progenitor neutron star of recycled pulsars span over a broad interval, from 1.1 Msun to 1.9 Msun. Including the effect of a slow Roche-lobe detachment phase, which as suggested recently by Tauris could be relevant for PSR J0751+1807, would make the lower mass limit even smaller. A realistic theory for core-collapse supernovae should account for this large range of mass.},

@article{Lombardi14,
	Abstract = {We present high-resolution, high dynamic range column-density and color-temperature maps of the Orion complex using a combination of Planck dust-emission maps, Herschel dust-emission maps, and 2MASS NIR dust-extinction maps. The column-density maps combine the robustness of the 2MASS NIR extinction maps with the resolution and coverage of the Herschel and Planck dust-emission maps and constitute the highest dynamic range column-density maps ever constructed for the entire Orion complex, covering 0.01 mag < AK < 30 mag, or 2 × 1020 cm-2 < N < 2 × 1023 cm-2. We determined the ratio of the 2.2 mum extinction coefficient to the 850mum opacity and found that the values obtained for both Orion A and B are significantly lower than the predictions of standard dust models, but agree with newer models that incorporate icy silicate-graphite conglomerates for the grain population. We show that the cloud projected probability distribution function, over a large range of column densities, can be well fitted by a simple power law. Moreover, we considered the local Schmidt-law for star formation, and confirm earlier results, showing that the protostar surface density Sigma* follows a simple law Sigma* ∝ Sigmagasbeta, with beta ~ 2.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) interstellar medium (ISM) maps can be used to locate not only interstellar (IS) clouds, but also IS bubbles between the clouds that are blown by stellar winds and supernovae, and that are filled by hot gas. To demonstrate this and to derive a clearer picture of the local ISM, we compare our recent 3D maps of the IS dust distribution to the ROSAT diffuse X-ray background maps after removing heliospheric emission. In the Galactic plane, there is a good correspondence between the locations and extents of the mapped nearby cavities and the soft (0.25 keV) background emission distribution, showing that most of these nearby cavities contribute to this soft X-ray emission. Assuming a constant dust-to-gas ratio and homogeneous 106 K hot gas filling the cavities, we modeled the 0.25 keV surface brightness in a simple way along the Galactic plane as seen from the Sun, taking the absorption by the mapped clouds into account. The data-model comparison favors the existence of hot gas in the solar neighborhood, the so-called Local Bubble (LB). The inferred average mean pressure in the local cavities is found to be on the order of 10 000 cm-3 K, in agreement with previous studies, providing a validation test for the method. On the other hand, the model overestimates the emission from the huge cavities located in the third quadrant. Using CaII absorption data, we show that the dust-to-CaII ratio is very low in this region, implying there is a large quantity of lower temperature (non-X-ray emitting) ionized gas and, as a consequence, a reduction in the volume filled by hot gas, explaining at least part of the discrepancy. In the meridian plane, the main two brightness enhancements coincide well with the LB's most elongated parts and chimneys connecting the LB to the halo, but no particular nearby cavity is found towards the enhancement in the direction of the bright North Polar Spur (NPS) at high latitude. We searched in the 3D maps for the source regions of the higher energy (0.75 keV) enhancements in the fourth and first quadrants. Tunnels and cavities are found to coincide with the main bright areas; however, no tunnel or cavity is found to match the low-latitude b ≳ 8$\,^{\circ}$, brightest part of the NPS. In addition, the comparison between the 3D maps and published spectral data do not favor the nearby cavities being located within ~200 pc as potential source regions for the NPS. Those examples illustrate the potential use of more detailed 3D distributions of the nearby ISM for interpreting the diffuse soft X-ray background.},

	Abstract = {The disruption of the M33 galaxy is evident from its extended gaseous structure. We present new data from the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array H I (GALFA-H I) Survey that show the full extent and detailed spatial and kinematic structure of M33's neutral hydrogen. Over 18% of the H I mass of M33 (M_HI_{tot}=1.4 × 10^9 M sun) is found beyond the star-forming disk as traced in the far-ultraviolet (FUV). The most distinct features are extended warps, an arc from the northern warp to the disk, diffuse gas surrounding the galaxy, and a southern cloud with a filament back to the galaxy. The features extend out to 22 kpc from the galaxy center (18 kpc from the edge of the FUV disk), and the gas is directly connected to M33's disk. Only five discrete clouds (i.e., gas not directly connected to M33 in position-velocity space) are cataloged in the vicinity of M33, and these clouds show similar properties to Galactic and M31 halo clouds. M33's gaseous features most likely originate from the tidal disruption of M33 by M31 1-3 Gyr ago as shown by an orbit analysis which results in a tidal radius <15 kpc in the majority of M33's possible orbits. M33 is now beyond the disruptive gravitational influence of M31, and the gas appears to be returning to M33's disk and redistributing its star formation fuel. M33's high mean velocity dispersion in the disk (~18.5 km s-1) may also be consistent with the previous interaction and high rate of star formation. M33 will either exhaust its star formation fuel in the next few Gyrs or eventually become star formation fuel for M31. The latter represents the accretion of a large gaseous satellite by a spiral galaxy, similar to the Magellanic Clouds' relationship to the Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {Positional, structural, and dynamical parameters for all dwarf galaxies in and around the Local Group are presented, and various aspects of our observational understanding of this volume-limited sample are discussed. Over 100 nearby galaxies that have distance estimates reliably placing them within 3 Mpc of the Sun are identified. This distance threshold samples dwarfs in a large range of environments, from the satellite systems of the MW and M31, to the quasi-isolated dwarfs in the outer regions of the Local Group, to the numerous isolated galaxies that are found in its surroundings. It extends to, but does not include, the galaxies associated with the next nearest groups, such as Maffei, Sculptor, and IC 342. Our basic knowledge of this important galactic subset and their resolved stellar populations will continue to improve dramatically over the coming years with existing and future observational capabilities, and they will continue to provide the most detailed information available on numerous aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. Basic observational parameters, such as distances, velocities, magnitudes, mean metallicities, as well as structural and dynamical characteristics, are collated, homogenized (as far as possible), and presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a convenient and current online resource. As well as discussing the provenance of the tabulated values and possible uncertainties affecting their usage, the membership and spatial extent of the MW sub-group, M31 sub-group, and the Local Group are explored. The morphological diversity of the entire sample and notable sub-groups is discussed, and timescales are derived for the Local Group members in the context of their orbital/interaction histories. The scaling relations and mean stellar metallicity trends defined by the dwarfs are presented, and the origin of a possible "floor" in central surface brightness (and, more speculatively, stellar mean metallicity) at faint magnitudes is considered.},

@article{Simon11,
	Abstract = {We present the results of a comprehensive Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic survey of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellite galaxy Segue 1. We have obtained velocity measurements for 98.2% of the stars within 67 pc (10', or 2.3 half-light radii) of the center of Segue 1 that have colors and magnitudes consistent with membership, down to a magnitude limit of r = 21.7. Based on photometric, kinematic, and metallicity information, we identify 71 stars as probable Segue 1 members, including some as far out as 87 pc. After correcting for the influence of binary stars using repeated velocity measurements, we determine a velocity dispersion of 3.7+1.4 - 1.1 km s-1. The mass within the half-light radius is 5.8+8.2 - 3.1 × 105 M sun. The stellar kinematics of Segue 1 require very high mass-to-light ratios unless the system is far from dynamical equilibrium, even if the period distribution of unresolved binary stars is skewed toward implausibly short periods. With a total luminosity less than that of a single bright red giant and a V-band mass-to-light ratio of 3400 M sun/L sun, Segue 1 is the darkest galaxy currently known. We critically re-examine recent claims that Segue 1 is a tidally disrupting star cluster and that kinematic samples are contaminated by the Sagittarius stream. The extremely low metallicities ([Fe/H] < -3) of two Segue 1 stars and the large metallicity spread among the members demonstrate conclusively that Segue 1 is a dwarf galaxy, and we find no evidence in favor of tidal effects. We also show that contamination by the Sagittarius stream has been overestimated. Segue 1 has the highest estimated dark matter density of any known galaxy and will therefore be a prime testing ground for dark matter physics and galaxy formation on small scales.  The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

@article{Clark14,
	Abstract = {We present observations of a new group of structures in the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium (ISM): slender, linear H I features we dub "fibers" that extend for many degrees at high Galactic latitude. To characterize and measure the extent and strength of these fibers, we present the Rolling Hough Transform, a new machine vision method for parameterizing the coherent linearity of structures in the image plane. With this powerful new tool we show that the fibers are oriented along the interstellar magnetic field as probed by starlight polarization. We find that these low column density (N_{H\,\scriptsize{I}} \simeq 5 \times 10^{18} cm--2) fiber features are most likely a component of the local cavity wall, about 100 pc away. The H I data we use to demonstrate this alignment at high latitude are from the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array H I (GALFA-H I) Survey and the Parkes Galactic All Sky Survey. We find better alignment in the higher resolution GALFA-H I data, where the fibers are more visually evident. This trend continues in our investigation of magnetically aligned linear features in the Riegel-Crutcher H I cold cloud, detected in the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. We propose an application of the RHT for estimating the field strength in such a cloud, based on the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. We conclude that data-driven, quantitative studies of ISM morphology can be very powerful predictors of underlying physical quantities.},

Using newly developed post-processing techniques for automatically identifying single bright astrophysical pulses, such as those emitted from RRATs, we have discovered approximately 30 new RRAT candidates in data from the Green Bank Telescope 350 MHz drift-scan survey. A total of 6 of these have already been confirmed and the remainder look extremely promising. Here we describe these techniques and present the most recent results on these new RRAT candidates.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted two pilot surveys for radio pulsars and fast transients with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) around 140 MHz and here report on the first low-frequency fast-radio burst limit and the discovery of two new pulsars. The first survey, the LOFAR Pilot Pulsar Survey (LPPS), observed a large fraction of the northern sky, ~1.4 x 10^4 sq. deg, with 1-hr dwell times. Each observation covered ~75 sq. deg using 7 independent fields formed by incoherently summing the high-band antenna fields. The second pilot survey, the LOFAR Tied-Array Survey (LOTAS), spanned ~600 sq. deg, with roughly a 5-fold increase in sensitivity compared with LPPS. Using a coherent sum of the 6 LOFAR "Superterp" stations, we formed 19 tied-array beams, together covering 4 sq. deg per pointing. From LPPS we derive a limit on the occurrence, at 142 MHz, of dispersed radio bursts of < 150 /day/sky, for bursts brighter than S > 107 Jy for the narrowest searched burst duration of 0.66 ms. In LPPS, we re-detected 65 previously known pulsars. LOTAS discovered two pulsars, the first with LOFAR or any digital aperture array. LOTAS also re-detected 27 previously known pulsars. These pilot studies show that LOFAR can efficiently carry out all-sky surveys for pulsars and fast transients, and they set the stage for further surveying efforts using LOFAR and the planned low-frequency component of the Square Kilometer Array.},

	Abstract = {We report initial results from AO327, a drift survey for pulsars with the Arecibo telescope at 327 MHz. The first phase of AO327 will cover the sky at declinations of -1$\,^{\circ}$ to 28$\,^{\circ}$, excluding the region within 5$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic plane, where high scattering and dispersion make low-frequency surveys sub-optimal. We record data from a 57 MHz bandwidth with 1024 channels and 125 mus sampling time. The 60 s transit time through the AO327 beam means that the survey is sensitive to very tight relativistic binaries even with no acceleration searches. To date we have detected 44 known pulsars with periods ranging from 3 ms to 2.21 s and discovered 24 new pulsars. The new discoveries include 3 ms pulsars, three objects with periods of a few tens of milliseconds typical of young as well as mildly recycled pulsars, a nuller, and a rotating radio transient. Five of the new discoveries are in binary systems. The second phase of AO327 will cover the sky at declinations of 28$\,^{\circ}$-38$\,^{\circ}$. We compare the sensitivity and search volume of AO327 to the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey and the GBT350 drift survey, both of which operate at 350 MHz.},

@article{Lorimer13,
	Abstract = {Recent discoveries of highly dispersed millisecond radio bursts by Thornton et al. in a survey with the Parkes radio telescope at 1.4 GHz point towards an emerging population of sources at cosmological distances whose origin is currently unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower radio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could be detectable at redshifts out to about z = 0.5 in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a source model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric luminosities ˜8 × 1044 ergs s-1 uniformly distributed per unit comoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as a function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by Thornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and redshift probed by a given survey. The non-detection of any such events in Arecibo 1.4 GHz survey data by Deneva et al., and the Allen Telescope Array survey by Siemion et al. is consistent with our model. Ongoing surveys in the 1-2 GHz band should result in further discoveries. At lower frequencies, assuming a typical radio spectral index alpha = -1.4, the predicted peak flux densities are 10 s of Jy. As a result, surveys of such a population with current facilities would not necessarily be sensitivity limited and could be carried out with small arrays to maximize the sky coverage. We predict that sources may already be present in 350 MHz surveys with the Green Bank Telescope. Surveys at 150 MHz with 30 deg2 fields of view could detect one source per hour above 30 Jy.},

	Abstract = {We carried out a search for pulsars in nearby galaxies with the GBT and Arecibo radio telescopes at 820 and 327 MHz, correspondingly. Currently, the Magellanic Clouds are the only galaxies except for Milky Way known to harbor radio pulsars, with a total of 20 pulsars being discovered there to date. Discovery of pulsars in other galaxies can be used to trace the history of massive star formation and would allow to probe the intermediate intergalactic medium. We selected 22 galaxies of the Local Group at high galactic latitudes, |b| > 26 deg, with most of them being dwarf spheroidals with old star population. This makes them promising targets to search for giant pulses from recycled millisecond pulsars. Both single-pulse and periodicity searches were performed for trial dispersion measures up to 1000. No extragalactic pulsars are found in half of the selected targets processed so far. I will give the overview of our targetted searches, present potential candidates and discuss the obtained results.},

	Abstract = {The stellar encounter rate Gamma has been shown to be strongly correlated with the number of X-ray binaries in globular clusters (GCs) and also to the number of radio pulsars. However, the pulsar populations in different GCs show remarkably different characteristics: in some GCs the population is dominated by binary systems, in others by single pulsars and exotic systems that result from exchange encounters. In this paper, we describe a second dynamical parameter for GCs, the encounter rate for a single binary, gamma. We find that this parameter provides a good characterization of the differences between the pulsar populations of different GCs. The higher gamma is for any particular GC, the more isolated pulsars and products of exchange interactions are observed. Furthermore, we also find that slow and "young" pulsars are found almost exclusively in clusters with a high gamma; this suggests that these kinds of objects are formed by the disruption of X-ray binaries, thus halting the recycling of a previously dead neutron star. We discuss the implications of this for the nature of young pulsars and for the formation of neutron stars in GCs.},

	Abstract = {Rotation-powered millisecond radio pulsars have been spun up to their present spin period by a 108-109 yr long X-ray-bright phase of accretion of matter and angular momentum in a low-to-intermediate mass binary system. Recently, the discovery of transitional pulsars that alternate cyclically between accretion and rotation-powered states on time scales of a few years or shorter, has demonstrated this evolutionary scenario. Here, we present a thorough statistical analysis of the spin distributions of the various classes of millisecond pulsars to assess the evolution of their spin period between the different stages. Accreting sources that showed oscillations exclusively during thermonuclear type I X-ray bursts (nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars) are found to be significantly faster than rotation-powered sources, while accreting sources that possess a magnetosphere and show coherent pulsations (accreting millisecond pulsars) are not. On the other hand, if accreting millisecond pulsars and eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars form a common class of transitional pulsars, these are shown to have a spin distribution intermediate between the faster nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars and the slower non-eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. We interpret these findings in terms of a spin-down due to the decreasing mass-accretion rate during the latest stages of the accretion phase, and in terms of the different orbital evolutionary channels mapped by the various classes of pulsars. We summarize possible instrumental selection effects, showing that even if an unbiased sample of pulsars is still lacking, their influence on the results of the presented analysis is reduced by recent improvements in instrumentation and searching techniques.},

	Abstract = {In the absence of constraints from the binary companion or supernova remnant, the standard method for estimating pulsar ages is to infer an age from the rate of spin-down. While the generic spin-down age may give realistic estimates for normal pulsars, it can fail for pulsars with very short periods. Details of the spin-up process during the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) phase pose additional constraints on the period (P) and spin-down rates (\dot{P}) that may consequently affect the age estimate. Here, we propose a new recipe to estimate millisecond pulsar (MSP) ages that parametrically incorporates constraints arising from binary evolution and limiting physics. We show that the standard method can be improved by this approach to achieve age estimates closer to the true age while the standard spin-down age may overestimate or underestimate the age of the pulsar by more than a factor of ~10 in the millisecond regime. We use this approach to analyze the population on a broader scale. For instance, in order to understand the dominant energy loss mechanism after the onset of radio emission, we test for a range of plausible braking indices. We find that a braking index of n = 3 is consistent with the observed MSP population. We demonstrate the existence and quantify the potential contributions of two main sources of age corruption: the previously known "age bias" due to secular acceleration and "age contamination" driven by sub-Eddington progenitor accretion rates. We explicitly show that descendants of LMXBs that have accreted at very low rates (\dot{m}≪\dot{M}_{Edd}) will exhibit ages that appear older than the age of the Galaxy. We further elaborate on this technique, the implications and potential solutions it offers regarding MSP evolution, the underlying age distribution, and the post-accretion energy loss mechanism.},

@article{Tauris12,
	Abstract = {Millisecond pulsars are mainly characterized by their spin periods, B-fields and masses - quantities that are largely affected by previous interactions with a companion star in a binary system. In this paper, we investigate the formation mechanism of millisecond pulsars by considering the pulsar recycling process in both intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The IMXBs mainly lead to the formation of binary millisecond pulsars with a massive carbon-oxygen (CO) or an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf (ONeMg WD) companion, whereas the LMXBs form recycled pulsars with a helium white dwarf (He WD) companion. We discuss the accretion physics leading to the spin-up line in the P P&sun;-diagram and demonstrate that such a line cannot be uniquely defined. We derive a simple expression for the amount of accreted mass needed for any given pulsar to achieve its equilibrium spin and apply this to explain the observed differences of the spin distributions of recycled pulsars with different types of companions. From numerical calculations we present further evidence for significant loss of rotational energy in accreting X-ray millisecond pulsars in LMXBs during the Roche-lobe decoupling phase (Tauris 2012) and demonstrate that the same effect is negligible in IMXBs. We examine the recycling of pulsars with CO WD companions via Case BB Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) of naked helium stars in post-common envelope binaries. We find that such pulsars typically accrete of the order of 0.002-0.007 M&sun; which is just about sufficient to explain their observed spin periods. We introduce isochrones of radio millisecond pulsars in the P P&sun;-diagram to follow their spin evolution and discuss their true ages from comparison with observations. Finally, we apply our results of the spin-up process to complement our investigation of the massive pulsar PSR J1614-2230 from Paper I, confirming that this system formed via stable Case A RLO in an IMXB and enabling us to put new constraints on the birth masses of a number of recycled pulsars.},

	Abstract = {Luminosity is an intrinsic property of radio pulsars related to the properties of the magnetospheric plasma and the beam geometry, and inversely proportional to the observing frequency. In traditional models, luminosity has been considered as a function of the spin parameters of pulsars. On the other hand, parameter independent models like power law and lognormal have been also used to fit the observed luminosities. Some of the older studies on pulsar luminosities neglected observational biases, but all of the recent studies tried to model observational effects as accurately as possible. Luminosities of pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) and in the Galactic disk have been studied separately. Older studies concluded that these two categories of pulsars have different luminosity distributions, but the most recent study concluded that those are the same. This paper reviews all significant works on pulsar luminosities and discusses open questions.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the birth and evolution of Galactic isolated radio pulsars. We begin by estimating their birth space velocity distribution from proper-motion measurements of Brisken and coworkers. We find no evidence for multimodality of the distribution and favor one in which the absolute one-dimensional velocity components are exponentially distributed and with a three-dimensional mean velocity of 380+40-60 km s-1. We then proceed with a Monte Carlo-based population synthesis, modeling the birth properties of the pulsars, their time evolution, and their detection in the Parkes and Swinburne Multibeam surveys. We present a population model that appears generally consistent with the observations. Our results suggest that pulsars are born in the spiral arms, with a galactocentric radial distribution that is well described by the functional form proposed by Yusifov & K{\"u}{\c c}{\"u}k, in which the pulsar surface density peaks at radius ~3 kpc. The birth spin period distribution extends to several hundred milliseconds, with no evidence of multimodality. Models that assume the radio luminosities of pulsars to be independent of the spin periods and period derivatives are inadequate, as they lead to the detection of too many old simulated pulsars in our simulations. Dithered radio luminosities proportional to the square root of the spin-down luminosity accommodate the observations well and provide a natural mechanism for the pulsars to dim uniformly as they approach the death line, avoiding an observed pileup on the latter. There is no evidence for significant torque decay (due to magnetic field decay or otherwise) over the lifetime of the pulsars as radio sources (~100 Myr). Finally, we estimate the pulsar birthrate and total number of pulsars in the Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {The computation of theoretical pulsar populations has been a major component of pulsar studies since the 1970s. However, the majority of pulsar population synthesis has only regarded isolated pulsar evolution. Those that have examined pulsar evolution within binary systems tend to either treat binary evolution poorly or evolve the pulsar population in an ad hoc manner. Thus, no complete and direct comparison with observations of the pulsar population within the Galactic disc has been possible to date. Described here is the first component of what will be a complete synthetic pulsar population survey code. This component is used to evolve both isolated and binary pulsars. Synthetic observational surveys can then be performed on this population for a variety of radio telescopes. The final tool used for completing this work will be a code comprised of three components: stellar/binary evolution, Galactic kinematics and survey selection effects. Results provided here support the need for further (apparent) pulsar magnetic field decay during accretion, while they conversely suggest the need for a re-evaluation of the assumed typical millisecond pulsar formation process. Results also focus on reproducing the observed diagram for Galactic pulsars and how this precludes short time-scales for standard pulsar exponential magnetic field decay. Finally, comparisons of bulk pulsar population characteristics are made to observations displaying the predictive power of this code, while we also show that under standard binary evolutionary assumption binary pulsars may accrete much mass.},

@article{Ivanova12,
	Abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs) effectively produce dynamically formed low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Observers detect ~100 times more LMXBs per stellar mass in GCs compared to stars in the fields of galaxies. Observationally, metal-rich GCs are about three times more likely to contain an X-ray source than their metal-poor counterparts. Recent observations have shown that this ratio holds in extragalactic GCs for all bright X-ray sources with L X between 2 × 1037 and 5 × 1038 erg s-1. In this Letter, we propose that the observed metallicity dependence of LMXBs in extragalactic GCs can be explained by the differences in the number densities and average masses of red giants in populations of different metallicities. Red giants serve as seeds for the dynamical production of bright LMXBs via two channels - binary exchanges and physical collisions - and the increase of the number densities and masses of red giants boost LMXB production, leading to the observed difference. We also discuss a possible effect of the age difference in stellar populations of different metallicities.},

We show that the numbers of barium stars and extrinsic S stars should be dramatically reduced in these galaxies compared to what is seen in the largest elliptical galaxies. Given that the extrinsic S stars show strong Wing-Ford band and Na I D absorption, we argue that the recent claims of different initial mass functions from the most massive elliptical galaxies versus lower mass ellipticals may be the result of extrinsic S stars, rather than bottom-heavy initial mass function.},

@article{Smith14,
	Abstract = {I present a comparison between published dynamical (ATLAS3D) and spectroscopic (Conroy & van Dokkum) constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in early-type galaxies, using the 34 galaxies in common between the two works. Both studies infer an average IMF mass factor alpha (the stellar mass relative to a Kroupa-IMF population of similar age and metallicity) greater than unity, i.e. both methods favour an IMF which is heavier than that of the Milky Way, on average over the sample. However, on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis, there is no correlation between alpha inferred from the two approaches. I investigate how the two estimates of alpha are correlated systematically with the galaxy velocity dispersion, sigma, and with the Mg/Fe abundance ratio. The spectroscopic method, based on the strengths of metal absorption lines, yields a correlation only with metal abundance ratios: at fixed Mg/Fe, there is no residual correlation with sigma. The dynamical method, applied to exactly the same galaxy sample, yields the opposite result: the IMF variation correlates only with dynamics, with no residual correlation with Mg/Fe after controlling for sigma. Hence, although both methods indicate a heavy IMF on average in ellipticals, they lead to incompatible results for the systematic trends, when applied to the same set of galaxies. The sense of the disagreement could suggest that one (or both) of the methods has not accounted fully for the main confounding factors, i.e. element abundance ratios or dark matter contributions. Alternatively, the poor agreement might indicate additional variation in the detailed shape of the IMF, beyond what can currently be inferred from the spectroscopic features.},

@article{Zahid14,
	Abstract = {We examine the mass-metallicity relation for z <~ 1.6. The mass-metallicity relation follows a steep slope with a turnover, or "knee," at stellar masses around 1010 M ☉. At stellar masses higher than the characteristic turnover mass, the mass-metallicity relation flattens as metallicities begin to saturate. We show that the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation depends only on the evolution of the characteristic turnover mass. The relationship between metallicity and the stellar mass normalized to the characteristic turnover mass is independent of redshift. We find that the redshift-independent slope of the mass-metallicity relation is set by the slope of the relationship between gas mass and stellar mass. The turnover in the mass-metallicity relation occurs when the gas-phase oxygen abundance is high enough that the amount of oxygen locked up in low-mass stars is an appreciable fraction of the amount of oxygen produced by massive stars. The characteristic turnover mass is the stellar mass, where the stellar-to-gas mass ratio is unity. Numerical modeling suggests that the relationship between metallicity and the stellar-to-gas mass ratio is a redshift-independent, universal relationship followed by all galaxies as they evolve. The mass-metallicity relation originates from this more fundamental universal relationship between metallicity and the stellar-to-gas mass ratio. We test the validity of this universal metallicity relation in local galaxies where stellar mass, metallicity, and gas mass measurements are available. The data are consistent with a universal metallicity relation. We derive an equation for estimating the hydrogen gas mass from measurements of stellar mass and metallicity valid for z <~ 1.6 and predict the cosmological evolution of galactic gas masses.},

	Abstract = {We describe an ongoing search for pulsars and dispersed pulses of radio emission, such as those from rotating radio transients (RRATs) and fast radio bursts, at 350 MHz using the Green Bank Telescope. With the Green Bank Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument, we record 100 MHz of bandwidth divided into 4096 channels every 81.92 mus. This survey will cover the entire sky visible to the Green Bank Telescope (delta > --40$\,^{\circ}$, or 82% of the sky) and outside of the Galactic Plane will be sensitive enough to detect slow pulsars and low dispersion measure (<30 pc cm--3) millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with a 0.08 duty cycle down to 1.1 mJy. For pulsars with a spectral index of --1.6, we will be 2.5 times more sensitive than previous and ongoing surveys over much of our survey region. Here we describe the survey, the data analysis pipeline, initial discovery parameters for 62 pulsars, and timing solutions for 5 new pulsars. PSR J0214+5222 is an MSP in a long-period (512 days) orbit and has an optical counterpart identified in archival data. PSR J0636+5129 is an MSP in a very short-period (96 minutes) orbit with a very low mass companion (8 M J). PSR J0645+5158 is an isolated MSP with a timing residual RMS of 500 ns and has been added to pulsar timing array experiments. PSR J1434+7257 is an isolated, intermediate-period pulsar that has been partially recycled. PSR J1816+4510 is an eclipsing MSP in a short-period orbit (8.7 hr) and may have recently completed its spin-up phase.},

Our search pipeline allows the detection of periodical signals and single dispersed pulses and it is optimized to search for millisecond radio pulsars. Here we present preliminary results of the searches we have conducted in the Ursa Minoris, Draco and Leo I dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies. Our searches have revealed no periodic signals but a few unconfirmed millisecond single pulses at various dispersion measures, possibly related to neutron stars. Detecting neutron stars in these systems can potentially help to test the existence of haloes of dark matter surrounding these systems as predicted by Dehnen & King (2006).},

	Abstract = {We have produced a new software package for the simulation of pulsar populations, PSRPOPPY, based on the PSRPOP package. The codebase has been re-written in Python (save for some external libraries, which remain in their native Fortran), utilizing the object-oriented features of the language, and improving the modularity of the code. Pre-written scripts are provided for running the simulations in `standard' modes of operation, but the code is flexible enough to support the writing of personalised scripts. The modular structure also makes the addition of experimental features (such as new models for period or luminosity distributions) more straightforward than with the previous code. We also discuss potential additions to the modelling capabilities of the software. Finally, we demonstrate some potential applications of the code; first, using results of surveys at different observing frequencies, we find pulsar spectral indices are best fitted by a normal distribution with mean -1.4 and standard deviation 1.0. Secondly, we model pulsar spin evolution to calculate the best fit for a relationship between a pulsar's luminosity and spin parameters. We used the code to replicate the analysis of Faucher-Gigu{\`e}re & Kaspi, and have subsequently optimized their power-law dependence of radio luminosity, L, with period, P, and period derivative, P. We find that the underlying population is best described by L ∝ P-1.39$\pm$0.09 P0.48$\pm$0.04 and is very similar to that found for gamma-ray pulsars by Perera et al. Using this relationship, we generate a model population and examine the age-luminosity relation for the entire pulsar population, which may be measurable after future large-scale surveys with the Square Kilometre Array.},

@article{Kroupa01,
	Abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices alpha are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Deltaalpha~0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto & Zoccali; Paresce & De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'e}ndez & Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

	Abstract = {The colour-magnitude diagrams of resolved single stellar populations, such as open and globular clusters, have provided the best natural laboratories to test stellar evolution theory. Whilst a variety of techniques have been used to infer the basic properties of these simple populations, systematic uncertainties arise from the purely geometrical degeneracy produced by the similar shape of isochrones of different ages and metallicities. Here we present an objective and robust statistical technique which lifts this degeneracy to a great extent through the use of a key observable: the number of stars along the isochrone. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations we show that, for instance, we can infer the four main parameters (age, metallicity, distance and reddening) in an objective way, along with robust confidence intervals and their full covariance matrix. We show that systematic uncertainties due to field contamination, unresolved binaries, initial or present-day stellar mass function are either negligible or well under control. This technique provides, for the first time, a proper way to infer with unprecedented accuracy the fundamental properties of simple stellar populations, in an easy-to-implement algorithm.},

@article{Larson98,
	Abstract = {It has frequently been suggested in the literature that the stellar IMF in galaxies was top-heavy at early times. This would be plausible physically if the IMF depended on a mass-scale such as the Jeans mass that was higher at earlier times because of the generally higher temperatures that were present then. In this paper it is suggested, on the basis of current evidence and theory, that the IMF has a universal Salpeter-like form at the upper end, but flattens below a characteristic stellar mass that may vary with time. Much of the evidence that has been attributed to a top-heavy early IMF, including the ubiquitous G-dwarf problem, the high abundance of heavy elements in clusters of galaxies, and the high rate of formation of massive stars in high-redshift galaxies, can be accounted for with such an IMF if the characteristic stellar mass was several times higher during the early stages of galaxy evolution. However, significant variations in the mass-to-light ratios of galaxies and large amounts of dark matter in stellar remnants are not as easily explained in this way, because they require more extreme and less plausible assumptions about the form and variability of the IMF. Metal-free `population III' stars are predicted to have an IMF that consists exclusively of massive stars, and they could help to account for some of the evidence that has been attributed to a top-heavy early IMF, as well as contributing importantly to the energetics and chemical enrichment of the early Universe.},

We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided that single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate on stellar populations that might produce gamma-ray bursts and jet-driven supernovae.},

	Abstract = {We model the observed black hole mass function under the assumption that black hole formation is controlled by the compactness of the stellar core at the time of collapse. Low compactness stars are more likely to explode as supernovae and produce neutron stars, while high compactness stars are more likely to be failed supernovae that produce black holes with the mass of the helium core of the star. Using three sequences of stellar models and marginalizing over a model for the completeness of the black hole mass function, we find that the compactness xi(2.5) above which 50% of core collapses produce black holes is xi(2.5)=0.24 (0.15 < xi(2.5) < 0.37) at 90% confidence). While models with a sharp transition between successful and failed explosions are always the most likely, the width of the transition between the minimum compactness for black hole formation and the compactness above which all core collapses produce black holes is not well constrained. The models also predict that f=0.18 (0.09 < f < 0.39) of core collapses fail assuming a minimum mass for core collapse of 8Msun. We tested four other criteria for black hole formation based on xi(2.0) and xi(3.0), the compactnesses at enclosed masses of 2.0 or 3.0 rather than 2.5Msun, the mass of the iron core, and the mass inside the oxygen burning shell. We found that xi(2.0) works as well as xi(2.5), while the compactness xi(3.0) works significantly worse, as does using the iron core mass or the mass enclosed by the oxygen burning shell. As expected from the high compactness of 20-25Msun stars, black hole formation in this mass range provides a natural explanation of the red supergiant problem.},

	Abstract = {We explore the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of a sample of 49 massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at 0.9<z<1.5. We base our analysis on intermediate resolution spectro-photometric data in the GOODS-N field taken in the near-infrared and optical with the HST/WFC3 G141 grism and the Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources (SHARDS). To constrain the slope of the IMF, we have measured the TiO2 spectral feature, whose strength depends strongly on the content of low-mass stars, as well as on stellar age. Using ultraviolet to near-infrared individual and stacked spectral energy distributions, we have independently estimated the stellar ages of our galaxies. For the heaviest z~1 MQGs (M > 10^11.0 Msun) we find an average age of 1.7$\pm$0.3 Gyr and a bottom-heavy IMF ({\Gamma}=3.2$\pm$0.2). Lighter MQGs (10^10.5 < M < 10^11.0 Msun) at the same redshift are younger on average (1.0$\pm$0.2 Gyr) and present a shallower IMF slope ({\Gamma}=2.7$\pm$0.3). Our results are in good agreement with the findings about the IMF slope in early-type galaxies of similar mass in the present-day Universe. This suggests that the IMF, a key characteristic of the stellar populations in galaxies, is bottom-heavier for more massive galaxies and has remained unchanged in the last ~8 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {We have used multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 data of the starbursting spiral galaxy M83 in order to measure variations in the upper end of the stellar initial mass function (uIMF) using the production rate of ionizing photons in unresolved clusters with ages $\leq$ 8 Myr. As in earlier papers on M51 and NGC 4214, the upper end of the stellar IMF in M83 is consistent with an universal IMF, and stochastic sampling of the stellar populations in the $\lessapprox$ 10$^{3}$ Msun clusters are responsible for any deviations in this universality. The ensemble cluster population, as well as individual clusters, also imply that the most massive star in a cluster does not depend on the cluster mass. In fact, we have found that these small clusters seem to have an over-abundance of ionizing photons when compared to an expected universal or truncated IMF. This also suggests that the presence of massive stars in these clusters does not affect the star formation in a destructive way.},

This potential, however, has not realized the bright-eyed hopes and dreams of the early pioneers who expected to revolutionise science education through the use of telescopes and other astronomical instrumentation in the classroom. In this paper, a general history and analysis of these attempts is presented. We define what we classify as an Astronomy Research in the Classroom (ARiC) project and note the major dimensions on which these projects differ before describing the 22 major student research projects active since the early 1990s. This is followed by a discussion of the major issues identified that affected the success of these projects and provide suggestions for similar attempts in the future.},

@article{Ridley13,
	Abstract = {We present the discovery of eight new radio pulsars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Five of these pulsars were found from reprocessing the Parkes Multibeam Survey of the Magellanic Clouds, while the remaining three were from an ongoing new survey at Parkes with a high-resolution data acquisition system. It is possible that these pulsars were missed in the earlier processing due to radio frequency interference, visual judgment or the large number of candidates that must be analysed. One of these new pulsars has a dispersion measure of 273 pc cm-3, almost twice the highest previously known value, making it possibly the most distant LMC pulsar. In addition, we present the null result of a radio pulse search of an X-ray point source located in SNR J0047.2-7308 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Although no millisecond pulsars have been found, these discoveries have increased the known rotation-powered pulsar population in the LMC by more than 50 per cent. Using the current sample of LMC pulsars, we used a Bayesian analysis to constrain the number of potentially observable pulsars in the LMC to within a 95 per cent credible interval of 57 000+70000-30000. The new survey at Parkes is ˜20 per cent complete, and it is expected to yield at most six millisecond pulsars in the LMC and SMC. Although it is very sensitive to short period pulsars, this new survey provides only a marginal increase in sensitivity to long periods. The limiting luminosity for this survey is 125 mJy kpc2 for the LMC which covers the upper 10 per cent of all known radio pulsars. The luminosity function for normal pulsars in the LMC is consistent with their counterparts in the Galactic disc. The maximum 1400 MHz radio luminosity for LMC pulsars is ˜1000 mJy kpc2.},

We detected all 11 previously known pulsars and have discovered nine others, all of which are millisecond pulsars in binary systems. We have searched the data for relatively short orbital period systems, and found one pulsar with an orbital period of 96 minutes, the shortest of any known radio pulsar. The increased rate of detections with the new system resulted in improved estimates of the flux density of the previously known pulsars, determination of the orbital parameters of one of them, and a coherent timing solution for another one. Five of the pulsars now known in 47 Tucanae have orbital periods of a few hours and implied companion masses of only ~0.03 Msolar. Two of these are eclipsed at some orbital phases, while three are seen at all phases at 20 cm but not always at lower frequencies. Four and possibly six of the other binary systems have longer orbital periods and companion masses ~0.2 Msolar, with at least two of them having relatively large orbital eccentricities. All 20 pulsars have rotation periods in the range 2-8 ms.},

	Abstract = {Recent searches for radio pulsars in globular clusters have targeted the millisecond pulsars (MSPs) that are expected to result from the spin-up of old neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems. These surveys have been very successful, discovering 34 pulsars, most of which are old and probably recycled by accretion-powered spin-up in a binary system. However, three objects have properties that are more like those of the normal population of Galactic pulsars. Timing measurements of one such pulsar, PSR B1745-20, show that it is clearly associated with the cluster NGC 6440 and that it is solitary and young, with a large magnetic field. This pulsar, together with PSR B1820-30B in NGC 6624, establishes long-period pulsars associated with globular clusters as a distinct group that seems to have a completely different genesis to the MSP population in globular clusters. Produced at a comparable rate to the MSPs, the origin of such apparently young objects in very old stellar systems is not understood.},

	Abstract = {We report results from the initial stage of a long-term pulsar survey of the Galactic plane using the Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA), a seven-beam receiver operating at 1.4 GHz with 0.3 GHz bandwidth, and fast-dump digital spectrometers. The search targets low Galactic latitudes, |b|<~5deg, in the accessible longitude ranges 32deg<~l<~77deg and 168deg<~l<~214deg. The instrumentation, data processing, initial survey observations, sensitivity, and database management are described. Data discussed here were collected over a 100 MHz passband centered on 1.42 GHz using a spectrometer that recorded 256 channels every 64 mus. Analysis of the data with their full time and frequency resolutions is ongoing. Here we report the results of a preliminary, low-resolution analysis for which the data were decimated to speed up the processing. We have detected 29 previously known pulsars and discovered 11 new ones. One of these, PSR J1928+1746, with a period of 69 ms and a relatively low characteristic age of 82 kyr, is a plausible candidate for association with the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1928+1733. Another, PSR J1906+07, is a nonrecycled pulsar in a relativistic binary with an orbital period of 3.98 hr. In parallel with the periodicity analysis, we also search the data for isolated dispersed pulses. This technique has resulted in the discovery of PSR J0628+09, an extremely sporadic radio emitter with a spin period of 1.2 s. Simulations we have carried out indicate that ~1000 new pulsars will be found in our ALFA survey. In addition to providing a large sample for use in population analyses and for probing the magnetoionic interstellar medium, the survey maximizes the chances of finding rapidly spinning millisecond pulsars and pulsars in compact binary systems. Our search algorithms exploit the multiple data streams from ALFA to discriminate between radio frequency interference and celestial signals, including pulsars and possibly new classes of transient radio sources.},

@article{Ho14,
	Abstract = {We demonstrate the feasibility and potential of using large integral field spectroscopic surveys to investigate the prevalence of galactic-scale outflows in the local Universe. Using integral field data from SAMI and the Wide Field Spectrograph, we study the nature of an isolated disk galaxy, SDSS J090005.05+000446.7 (z = 0.05386). In the integral field datasets, the galaxy presents skewed line profiles changing with position in the galaxy. The skewed line profiles are caused by different kinematic components overlapping in the line-of-sight direction. We perform spectral decomposition to separate the line profiles in each spatial pixel as combinations of (1) a narrow kinematic component consistent with HII regions, (2) a broad kinematic component consistent with shock excitation, and (3) an intermediate component consistent with shock excitation and photoionisation mixing. The three kinematic components have distinctly different velocity fields, velocity dispersions, line ratios, and electron densities. We model the line ratios, velocity dispersions, and electron densities with our MAPPINGS IV shock and photoionisation models, and we reach remarkable agreement between the data and the models. The models demonstrate that the different emission line properties are caused by major galactic outflows that introduce shock excitation in addition to photoionisation by star-forming activities. Interstellar shocks embedded in the outflows shock-excite and compress the gas, causing the elevated line ratios, velocity dispersions, and electron densities observed in the broad kinematic component. We argue from energy considerations that, with the lack of a powerful active galactic nucleus, the outflows are likely to be driven by starburst activities. Our results set a benchmark of the type of analysis that can be achieved by the SAMI Galaxy Survey on large numbers of galaxies.},

@article{Leja14,
	Abstract = {We examine the connection between the observed "star-forming sequence" (SFR $\propto$ M$_{*}^{\alpha}$) and the observed evolution of the stellar mass function between $0.2 < z < 2.5$. We find that the star-forming sequence cannot have a slope $\alpha$ $\lesssim$ 0.9 at all masses and redshifts, as this results in a much higher number density at $10 < \log(\mathrm{M}) < 11$ by $z=1$ than is observed. We show that a transition in the slope of the star-forming sequence, such that $\alpha=1$ at $\log(M)<10.5$ and $\alpha=0.7-0.13z$ \citep{whitaker12} at $\log(M)>10.5$, greatly improves agreement with the evolution of the stellar mass function. We then construct a star-forming sequence which exactly reproduces the evolution of the mass function. This star-forming sequence is also well-described by a broken-power law, with a shallow slope at high masses and a steep slope at low masses. At $z=2$, it is offset by $\sim$0.3 dex from the observed star-forming sequence, consistent with the mild disagreement between the cosmic SFR and the growth of the stellar mass density in recent determinations of the mass function. It is unclear whether this problem stems from errors in stellar mass estimates, errors in SFRs, or other effects. We show that a mass-dependent slope is also seen in self-consistent theoretical models of galaxy evolution, including semi-analytical, hydrodynamical, and abundance-matching models. As part of the analysis, we show that neither mergers nor an unknown population of quiescent galaxies are likely to reconcile the evolution of the low-mass stellar mass function and the observed star-forming sequence. These results are supported by observations from Whitaker et al. (2014).},

@article{Martin08,
	Abstract = {We derive the structural parameters of the recently discovered very low luminosity Milky Way satellites through a maximum likelihood algorithm applied to SDSS data. For each satellite, even when only a few tens of stars are available down to the SDSS flux limit, the algorithm yields robust estimates and errors for the centroid, position angle, ellipticity, exponential half-light radius and number of member stars (within the SDSS). This latter parameter is then used in conjunction with stellar population models of the satellites to derive their absolute magnitudes and stellar masses, accounting for color-magnitude diagram shot noise. Most parameters are in good agreement with previous determinations, but we now properly account for parameter covariances. However, we find that faint satellites are somewhat more elliptical than initially thought, and ascribe this effect to the previous use of smoothed maps, which can be dominated by the smoothing (round) kernel. As a result, the faintest half of the Milky Way dwarf galaxies (MV>~-7.5) is significantly (4 sigma) flatter (<ε>=0.47+/-0.03) than its brightest half (MV<~-7.5, <ε>=0.32+/-0.02). From our best models, we also investigate whether the seemingly distorted shape of the satellites, often taken to be a sign of tidal distortion, can be quantified. We find that, except for tentative evidence of distortion in Canes Venatici I and Ursa Major II, these can be completely accounted for by Poisson scatter in the sparsely sampled systems. We consider three scenarios that could explain the rather elongated shape of faint satellites: rotation supported systems, stars following the shape of more triaxial dark matter subhalos, or elongation due to tidal interaction with the Milky Way. Although none of these is entirely satisfactory, the last one appears the least problematic, but obviously warrants much deeper observations to track evidence of such tidal interaction.},

	Abstract = {Star-formation rates (SFR) of disk galaxies strongly correlate with stellar mass, with a small dispersion in SSFR at fixed mass, sigma~0.3 dex. With such small scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as deterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple consequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by approximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a random walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at the previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of star-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for stochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are correlated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an expectation that <SSFR> should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have a relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and its evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to constrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important observables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation. The evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways to generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as mergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the classification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous formation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their star-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's insensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the ability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic baselines.

	Abstract = {We explore the ranges and distributions which will result for the intrinsic stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) values of single stellar populations, at fixed initial mass function (IMF), age and metallicity, from the discrete stochastic sampling of a probabilistic IMF. As the total mass of a certain stellar population tends to infinity, the corresponding M/L values quickly converge to fixed numbers associated with the particulars of the IMF, age, metallicity and star formation histories in question. When going to small stellar populations, however, a natural inherent spread will appear for the M/L values, which will become probabilistic quantities. For the recently discovered ultrafaint local dwarf spheroidal galaxies, with total luminosities dropping below 103LV/L&sun;, it is important to asses the amplitude of the probabilistic spread in inherent M/L values mentioned above. The total baryonic masses of these systems are usually estimated from their observed luminosities, and the assumption of a fixed, deterministic M/L value, suitable for the infinite population limit of the assumed ages and metallicities of the stellar populations in question. This total baryonic masses are crucial for testing and calibrating of structure formation scenarios, as the local ultrafaint dwarf spheroidals represent the most extreme galactic scales known. Also, subject to reliable M/L values is the use of these systems as possible discriminants between dark matter and modified gravity theories. By simulating large collections of stellar populations, each consisting of a particular collection of individual stars, we compute statistical distributions for the resulting M/L values. We find that for total numbers of stars in the range of what is observed for the local ultrafaint dwarf spheroidals, the inherent M/L values of stellar populations can be expected to vary by factors of upwards of 3, interestingly, systematically skewed towards higher values than what is obtained for the corresponding infinite stellar population limit M/L. This can serve to explain part of the spread in reported baryonic masses for these systems, which also appear as shifted systematically towards high dark-to-baryonic mass ratios at fixed stellar velocity dispersions, when going to the ultrafaint limit.},

	Abstract = {The Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array (PALFA) Survey uses the ALFA 7-beam receiver to search both inner and outer Galactic sectors visible from Arecibo (32$\,^{\circ}$ <~ l <~ 77$\,^{\circ}$ and 168$\,^{\circ}$ <~ l <~ 214$\,^{\circ}$) close to the Galactic plane (|b| <~ 5$\,^{\circ}$) for pulsars. The PALFA survey is sensitive to sources fainter and more distant than have previously been seen because of Arecibo's unrivaled sensitivity. In this paper we detail a precursor survey of this region with PALFA, which observed a subset of the full region (slightly more restrictive in l and |b| <~ 1$\,^{\circ}$) and detected 45 pulsars. Detections included 1 known millisecond pulsar and 11 previously unknown, long-period pulsars. In the surveyed part of the sky that overlaps with the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey (36$\,^{\circ}$ <~ l <~ 50$\,^{\circ}$), PALFA is probing deeper than the Parkes survey, with four discoveries in this region. For both Galactic millisecond and normal pulsar populations, we compare the survey's detections with simulations to model these populations and, in particular, to estimate the number of observable pulsars in the Galaxy. We place 95% confidence intervals of 82,000 to 143,000 on the number of detectable normal pulsars and 9000 to 100,000 on the number of detectable millisecond pulsars in the Galactic disk. These are consistent with previous estimates. Given the most likely population size in each case (107,000 and 15,000 for normal and millisecond pulsars, respectively), we extend survey detection simulations to predict that, when complete, the full PALFA survey should have detected 1000^{+330}_{-230} normal pulsars and 30^{+200}_{-20} millisecond pulsars. Identical estimation techniques predict that 490^{+160}_{-115} normal pulsars and 12^{+70}_{-5} millisecond pulsars would be detected by the beginning of 2014; at the time, the PALFA survey had detected 283 normal pulsars and 31 millisecond pulsars, respectively. We attribute the deficiency in normal pulsar detections predominantly to the radio frequency interference environment at Arecibo and perhaps also scintillation---both effects that are currently not accounted for in population simulation models.},

@article{Micic06,
	Abstract = {Primordial stars are likely to be very massive (>= 30 Msolar), form in isolation, and will likely leave black holes as remnants in the centres of their host dark matter haloes. We expect primordial stars to form in haloes in the mass range 106-1010 Msolar. Some of these early black holes, formed at redshifts z >~ 10, could be the seed black holes for a significant fraction of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) found in galaxies in the local Universe. If the black hole descendants of the primordial stars exist, their merger with nearby SMBHs may be a prime candidate for long wavelength gravitational wave detectors. We simulate formation and evolution of dark matter haloes in a Lambda cold dark matter universe. We seed high-redshift dark matter haloes with early black holes, and explore the merger history of the host haloes and the implications of black hole kick velocities arising from their coalescence. The central concentration of low-mass early black holes in present-day galaxies is reduced if they experience even moderate kicks of tens of km s-1. Even such modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their parent halo, which consequently leads to dynamical friction being less effective on the low-mass black holes that were ejected, compared to those still embedded in their parent haloes. Therefore, merger rates with central SMBHs in the largest halo may be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. Using analytical and illustrative cosmological N-body simulations, we quantify the role of kicks on the merger rates of black holes formed from massive metal-free stars with SMBHs in present-day galaxies.},

@article{Peacock14,
	Abstract = {A number of recent studies have proposed that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) of early type galaxies varies systematically as a function of galaxy mass, with higher mass galaxies having bottom-heavy IMFs. These bottom-heavy IMFs have more low-mass stars relative to the number of high mass stars, and therefore naturally result in proportionally fewer neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). In this paper, we specifically predict the variation in the number of BHs and NSs based on the power-law IMF variation required to reproduce the observed mass-to-light ratio trends with galaxy mass. We then test whether such variations are observed by studying the field low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) populations of nearby early-type galaxies. In these binaries, an NS or BH accretes matter from a low-mass donor star. Their number is therefore expected to scale with the number of BHs and NSs present in a galaxy. We find that the number of LMXBs per K-band light is similar among the galaxies in our sample. These data therefore demonstrate the uniformity of the slope of the IMF from massive stars down to those now dominating the K-band light and are consistent with an invariant IMF. Our results are inconsistent with an IMF which varies from a Kroupa/Chabrier like IMF for low-mass galaxies to a steep power-law IMF (with slope x = 2.8) for high mass galaxies. We discuss how these observations constrain the possible forms of the IMF variations and how future Chandra observations can enable sharper tests of the IMF.

The scientific results reported in this article are based in part on data obtained from the Chandra Data Archive and observations made by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and published previously in cited articles.},

	Abstract = {Most massive galaxies are thought to have formed their dense stellar cores at early cosmic epochs. However, cores in their formation phase have not yet been observed. Previous studies have found galaxies with high gas velocity dispersions or small apparent sizes but so far no objects have been identified with both the stellar structure and the gas dynamics of a forming core. Here we present a candidate core in formation 11 billion years ago, at z=2.3. GOODS-N-774 has a stellar mass of 1.0x10^11 Msun, a half-light radius of 1.0 kpc, and a star formation rate of 90[+45-20]Msun/yr. The star forming gas has a velocity dispersion 317+-30 km/s, amongst the highest ever measured. It is similar to the stellar velocity dispersions of the putative descendants of GOODS-N-774, compact quiescent galaxies at z~2 and giant elliptical galaxies in the nearby Universe. Galaxies such as GOODS-N-774 appear to be rare; however, from the star formation rate and size of the galaxy we infer that many star forming cores may be heavily obscured, and could be missed in optical and near-infrared surveys.},

@article{Kriek09,
	Abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies at z ~ 2 are in a quiescent phase. Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be ultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. We have obtained a ~29 hr spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z = 2.1865 with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z > 2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 M sun yr-1, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2 × 1011 M sun. We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [N II]/Halpha, [S II]/Halpha, and [O II]/[O III] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR is <1% of the past average SFR. If this galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z = 2, it implies that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes lsim8% to the rest-frame optical emission. A possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up lsim10% of the total stellar mass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. Nevertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

@article{Cowie96,
	Abstract = {We present the results of spectroscopic studies with the LRIS spectrograph on Keck of two of the Hawaii deep survey fields. The 393 objects observed cover a 26.2 arcmin^2^ area and constitute a nearly complete sample down to K = 20, I = 23, and B = 24.5. The rest-frame K- band luminosity function and its evolution with redshift are described. Comparisons are made with other optically selected (B and I) samples in the literature, and the corresponding rest-frame B-band luminosity function evolution is presented. The B-band counts at B ~ 24 are shown to be a mixture of normal galaxies at modest redshifts and galaxies undergoing rapid star formation, which have a wide range of masses and which are spread over the redshift interval from z = 0.2 to beyond z = 1.7. The luminosity functions, number counts, and color distributions at optical and IR wavelengths are discussed in terms of a consistent picture of the star-forming history of the galaxy sample. [O II] emission-line diagnostics or rest-frame ultraviolet-infrared color information are used in combination with rest-frame absolute H magnitudes to construct a "fundamental plane" in which the evolution of the global star-formation rate with redshift can be shown, and we find that the maximum rest-frame K luminosity of galaxies undergoing rapid star formation has been declining smoothly with decreasing redshift from a value near L_*_ at z > 1. This smooth decrease in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies dominated by star formation can simultaneously account for the high B- band galaxy counts at faint magnitudes and the redshift distribution at z < 1 in both the B- and K-selected samples. Finally, the overall K-band light density evolution is discussed as a tracer of the baryonic mass in stars and compared with the overall rates of star formation inferred from the rest-frame ultraviolet light density as a function of redshift.},

@article{Brammer08,
	Abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or are only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semianalytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Qz, which provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not ''trained'' on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public data sets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields, we find a 1 sigma scatter in Deltaz/(1+z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

	Abstract = {We present deep near-IR (NIR) medium-bandwidth photometry over the wavelength range 1-1.8 mum in the All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey (AEGIS) and Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) fields. The observations were carried out using the NOAO Extremely Wide-Field Infrared Imager (NEWFIRM) on the Mayall 4 m Telescope on Kitt Peak as part of the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS), an NOAO survey program. In this paper, we describe the full details of the observations, data reduction, and photometry for the survey. We also present a public K-selected photometric catalog, along with accurate photometric redshifts. The redshifts are computed with 37 (20) filters in the COSMOS (AEGIS) fields, combining the NIR medium-bandwidth data with existing UV (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), visible and NIR (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and Subaru Telescope), and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC) imaging. We find excellent agreement with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts, with sigma z /(1 + z) ~ 1%-2% for ~4000 galaxies at z = 0-3. The NMBS catalogs contain ~13,000 galaxies at z > 1.5 with accurate photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors. Due to the increased spectral resolution obtained with the five NIR medium-band filters, the median 68% confidence intervals of the photometric redshifts of both quiescent and star-forming galaxies are a factor of about two times smaller when comparing catalogs with medium-band NIR photometry to NIR broadband photometry. We show evidence for a clear bimodal color distribution between quiescent and star-forming galaxies that persists to z ~ 3, a higher redshift than has been probed so far.},

In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3um -8um. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point spread function into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging datasets were used in the analysis. The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. In a companion paper (I. Momcheva et al., in preparation) we present line diagnostics and improved redshifts from an analysis of the combination of the photometry with the grism spectra. All the data presented in this paper are available through the 3D-HST website.},

	Abstract = {We construct and analyse a u-band selected galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Southern Survey, which covers 275deg2. The sample includes 43223 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0.005 < z < 0.3 and with 14.5 < u < 20.5. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in the u-band Petrosian aperture is improved by co-adding multiple epochs of imaging data and by including sky-subtraction corrections. Luminosity functions for the near-UV 0.1u band (lambda~ 322 +/- 26nm) are determined in redshift slices of width 0.02, which show a highly significant evolution in M* of -0.8 +/- 0.1 mag between z= 0 and 0.3; with M*-5 logh70=-18.84 +/- 0.05 (AB mag), logphi*=-2.06 +/- 0.03 (h370Mpc-3) and logrhoL= 19.11 +/- 0.02 (h70WHz-1Mpc-3) at z= 0.1. The faint-end slope determined for z < 0.06 is given by alpha=-1.05 +/- 0.08. This is in agreement with recent determinations from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer at shorter wavelengths. Comparing our z < 0.3 luminosity density measurements with 0.2 < z < 1.2 from Classifying Objects by Medium Band Observations in 17 Filters (COMBO-17), we find that the 280-nm density evolves as rhoL~ (1 +z)beta with beta= 2.1 +/- 0.2; and find no evidence for any change in slope over this redshift range. By comparing with other measurements of cosmic star formation history, we estimate that the effective dust attenuation at 280nm has increased by 0.8 +/- 0.3mag between z= 0 and 1.},

	Abstract = {We identify 73 z ~ 7 and 59 z ~ 8 candidate galaxies in the reionization epoch, and use this large 26-29.4 AB mag sample of galaxies to derive very deep luminosity functions to < - 18 AB mag and the star formation rate (SFR) density at z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 (just 800 Myr and 650 Myr after recombination, respectively). The galaxy sample is derived using a sophisticated Lyman-break technique on the full two-year Wide Field Camera 3/infrared (WFC3/IR) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) data available over the HUDF09 (~29.4 AB mag, 5sigma), two nearby HUDF09 fields (~29 AB mag, 5sigma, 14 arcmin2), and the wider area Early Release Science (~27.5 AB mag, 5sigma, ~40 arcmin2). The application of strict optical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low (just ~7% in the HUDF). This very low value includes a full assessment of the contamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, active galactic nuclei, spurious sources, low-mass stars, and transients (e.g., supernovae). From careful modeling of the selection volumes for each of our search fields, we derive luminosity functions for galaxies at z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 to < - 18 AB mag. The faint-end slopes alpha at z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01 $\pm$ 0.21 and alpha = -1.91 $\pm$ 0.32, respectively. Such steep slopes contrast to the local alpha >~ -1.4 and may even be steeper than that at z ~ 4 where alpha = -1.73 $\pm$ 0.05. With such steep slopes (alpha <~ -1.7) lower luminosity galaxies dominate the galaxy luminosity density during the epoch of reionization. The SFR densities derived from these new z ~ 7 and z ~ 8 luminosity functions are consistent with the trends found at later times (lower redshifts). We find reasonable consistency with the SFR densities implied from reported stellar mass densities being only ~40% higher at z < 7. This suggests that (1) the stellar mass densities inferred from the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry are reasonably accurate and (2) that the initial mass function at very high redshift may not be very different from that at later times.

@article{Marchesini09,
	Abstract = {We present the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies from z = 4.0 to z = 1.3 measured from a sample constructed from the deep near-infrared Multi-wavelength Survey by Yale-Chile, the Faint Infrared Extragalactic Survey, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-Chandra Deep Field South surveys, all having very high-quality optical to mid-infrared data. This sample, unique in that it combines data from surveys with a large range of depths and areas in a self-consistent way, allowed us to (1) minimize the uncertainty due to cosmic variance and empirically quantify its contribution to the total error budget; (2) simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the low-mass end (down to ~0.05 times the characteristic stellar mass) of the SMF with good statistics; and (3) empirically derive the redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random and systematic uncertainties affecting the derived SMFs, including the effect of metallicity, extinction law, stellar population synthesis model, and initial mass function. We find that the mass density evolves by a factor of ~17+7 -10 since z = 4.0, mostly driven by a change in the normalization Phisstarf. If only random errors are taken into account, we find evidence for mass-dependent evolution, with the low-mass end evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. However, we show that this result is no longer robust when systematic uncertainties due to the SED-modeling assumptions are taken into account. Another significant uncertainty is the contribution to the overall stellar mass density of galaxies below our mass limit; future studies with WFC3 will provide better constraints on the SMF at masses below 1010 M sun at z>2. Taking our results at face value, we find that they are in conflict with semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The models predict SMFs that are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too few high-mass galaxies. The discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible to uncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the low-mass end may be more difficult to explain.

	Abstract = {We explore a large uniformly selected sample of Halpha selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47, 2.23 to unveil the evolution of the star formation rate (SFR) function and the stellar mass function. We find strong evolution in the SFR function, with the typical SFR of SFGs declining exponentially in the last 11 Gyr as SFR*(T[Gyr]) = 104.23/T + 0.37 M&sun; yr-1, but with no evolution in the faint-end slope, alpha ≈ -1.6. The stellar mass function of SFGs, however, reveals little evolution: alpha ≈ -1.4, M* ˜ 1011.2 $\pm$ 0.2 M&sun; and just a slight increase of ˜2.3× in Phi* from z = 2.23 to z = 0.4. The stellar mass density within SFGs has been roughly constant since z = 2.23 at ˜107.65 $\pm$ 0.08 M&sun; Mpc-3, comprising ≈100 per cent of the stellar mass density in all galaxies at z = 2.23, and declining to ≈20 per cent by z = 0.40, driven by the rise of the passive population. We find that SFGs with ˜1010.0 $\pm$ 0.2 M&sun; contribute most to the SFR density (rhoSFR) per d log10M, and that there is no significant evolution in the fractional contribution from SFGs of different masses to rhoSFR or rhoSFR(d log10M)-1 since z = 2.23. Instead, we show that the decline of SFR* and of rhoSFR is primarily driven by an exponential decline in SFRs at all masses. Our results have important implications not only on how SFGs need to be quenched across cosmic time, but also on the driver(s) of the exponential decline in SFR* from ˜66 M&sun; yr-1 to 5 M&sun; yr-1 since z ˜ 2.23.},

	Abstract = {We study the star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass (M sstarf) relation in a self-consistent manner from 0 < z < 2.5 with 22,816 star-forming galaxies selected from the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey. We find a significant nonlinear slope of the relation, SFRvpropM 0.6 sstarf, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex, independent of redshift and M sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54% for log (M sstarf) > 10 at 1 < z < 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11%), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7%). The remaining 28% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

	Abstract = {Using observations from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE), we obtain the deepest measurements to date of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) at 0.2 < z < 3. ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2 mum. We combine this with Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses of ~109.5 M &sun; at z ~ 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z <= 1.5 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the SMF, leading to an upturn at masses <1010 M &sun; that is not well described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z ~ 2 and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (M*) and slope at the lowest masses (alpha) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log(M/M &sun;) ~ 10.65 and ~ - 1.5, respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. Our data allow us, for the first time, to observe a rapid buildup at the low-mass end of the quiescent SMF. Since z = 2.5, the total stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies (down to 109 M &sun;) has increased by a factor of ~12, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies only increases by a factor of ~2.2.  This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.},

	Abstract = {We measure spectral features of ~3500 K-selected galaxies at 0.5 < z < 2.0 from high-quality medium-band photometry using a new technique. First, we divide the galaxy sample in 32 subsamples based on the similarities between the full spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the galaxies. For each of these 32 galaxy types we construct a composite SED by de-redshifting and scaling the observed photometry. This approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio and sampling of galaxy SEDs and allows for model-independent stellar population studies. The composite SEDs are of spectroscopic quality and facilitate---for the first time---Halpha measurements for a large magnitude-limited sample of distant galaxies. The line widths indicate a photometric redshift uncertainty of Deltaz < 0.02 × (1 + z). The composite SEDs also show the Balmer and 4000 {\AA} breaks, Mg II absorption at ~2800 {\AA}, the dust absorption feature at 2175 {\AA}, and blended [O III]+Hbeta emission. We compare the total equivalent width of Halpha, [N II], and [S II] (W Halpha +) with the strength of the 4000 {\AA} break (D(4000)) and the best-fit specific star formation rate, and find that all these properties are strongly correlated. This is a reassuring result, as currently most distant stellar population studies are based on just continuum emission. Furthermore, the relation between W Halpha + and D(4000) provides interesting clues to the star formation histories of galaxies, as these features are sensitive to different stellar ages. We find that the correlation between W Halpha + and D(4000) at 0.5 < z < 2.0 is similar to z ~ 0 and that the suppression of star formation in galaxies at z < 2 is generally not abrupt, but a gradual process.},

@article{Kriek10,
	Abstract = {Stellar population synthesis (SPS) models are a key ingredient of many galaxy evolution studies. Unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated for certain stellar evolution stages. Of particular concern is the treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase, as different implementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties. Post-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as TP-AGB stars are thought to be most prominently visible during this phase. Here, we use post-starburst galaxies in the NEWFIRM medium-band survey to assess different SPS models. The available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous and well-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7 <~ z <~ 2.0, from which we construct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (SED) over the range 1200-40000 {\AA}. The SED is well fit by the Bruzual & Charlot SPS models, while the Maraston models do not reproduce the rest-frame optical and near-infrared parts of the SED simultaneously. When the fitting is restricted to lambda < 6000 {\AA}, the Maraston models overpredict the near-infrared luminosity, implying that these models give too much weight to TP-AGB stars. Using the flexible SPS models by Conroy et al. and assuming solar metallicity, we find that the contribution of TP-AGB stars to the integrated SED is a factor of ~3 lower than predicted by the latest Padova TP-AGB models. Whether this is due to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dust obscuration of TP-AGB stars remains to be addressed. Altogether, our data demand a low contribution from TP-AGB stars to the SED of post-starburst galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present 3D-HST, a near-infrared spectroscopic Treasury program with the Hubble Space Telescope for studying the physical processes that shape galaxies in the distant universe. 3D-HST provides rest-frame optical spectra for a sample of ~7000 galaxies at 1 < z < 3.5, the epoch when ~60% of all star formation took place, the number density of quasars peaked, the first galaxies stopped forming stars, and the structural regularity that we see in galaxies today must have emerged. 3D-HST will cover three quarters (625 arcmin2) of the CANDELS Treasury survey area with two orbits of primary WFC3/G141 grism coverage and two to four orbits with the ACS/G800L grism in parallel. In the IR, these exposure times yield a continuum signal-to-noise ratio of ~5 per resolution element at H 140 ~ 23.1 and a 5sigma emission-line sensitivity of ~5 × 10-17 erg s-1 cm-2 for typical objects, improving by a factor of ~2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. The WFC3/G141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1 to 1.6 mum at a spatial resolution of ~0farcs13, which, combined with their depth, makes them a unique resource for studying galaxy evolution. We present an overview of the preliminary reduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission-line and redshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra and photometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. The present analysis yields redshift estimates with a precision of sigma(z) = 0.0034(1 + z), or sigma(v) ≈ 1000 km s-1. We illustrate how the generalized nature of the survey yields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types of objects, including a quasar at z = 4.7, quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2, and the most distant T-type brown dwarf star known. The combination of the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys will provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic data set for studies of the 1 < z < 3.5 universe until the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs 12177 and 12328.},

	Abstract = {We select 25,000 galaxies from the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey (NMBS) to study the rest-frame U - V color distribution of galaxies at 0 < z lsim 2.5. The five unique NIR filters of the NMBS enable the precise measurement of photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors for 9900 galaxies at 1 < z < 2.5. The rest-frame U - V color distribution at all z lsim 2.5 is bimodal, with a red peak, a blue peak, and a population of galaxies in between (the green valley). Model fits to the optical-NIR spectral energy distributions and the distribution of MIPS-detected galaxies indicate that the colors of galaxies in the green valley are determined largely by the amount of reddening by dust. This result does not support the simplest interpretation of green valley objects as a transition from blue star forming to red quiescent galaxies. We show that correcting the rest-frame colors for dust reddening allows a remarkably clean separation between the red and blue sequences up to z ~ 2.5. Our study confirms that dusty-starburst galaxies can contribute a significant fraction to red-sequence samples selected on the basis of a single rest-frame color (i.e., U - V), so extra care must be taken if samples of truly "red and dead" galaxies are desired. Interestingly, of galaxies detected at 24 mum, 14% remain on the red sequence after applying the reddening correction.},

	Abstract = {Galactic luminosity functions (LFs) and their applications in cosmological computations are discussed in an analytical review. The history and definitions of general and more specific LFs are recalled, and it is argued that the general LF is not universal and hence of only limited value. Particular attention is given to the relationship between LF and density function, the magnitudes employed, the selection of galaxies, and methods for determining the LF for field and cluster galaxies. Recent determinations of the galactic LF, for field and cluster galaxies, over all Hubble types and for different Hubble types, and for different environments are then surveyed, and a number of outstanding theoretical and observational problems are indicated.},

	Abstract = {We present initial results of a large near-IR spectroscopic survey covering the 15 fields of the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) using the recently-commissioned MOSFIRE instrument on the Keck 1 10m telescope. We focus on 179 galaxies with redshifts 2.0 < z < 2.6, most of which have high-quality MOSFIRE spectra in both H and K-band atmospheric windows, allowing sensitive measurements of [OIII]4960,5008, H-beta, [NII]6585, and H-alpha emission lines. We show unambiguously that the locus of z~2.3 galaxies in the "BPT" nebular diagnostic diagram exhibits an almost entirely disjoint, yet similarly tight, relationship between the line ratios [NII]/Halpha and [OIII]/Hbeta as compared to local galaxies. We argue that the offset of the z~2.3 BPT locus relative to that at z~0 is caused primarily by higher excitation (driven by both higher ionization parameter and harder stellar ionizing radiation field) than applies to most local galaxies. Also unlike nearby counterparts, a z~2.3 galaxy's position along the BPT locus is surprisingly insensitive to gas-phase O/H. The observed emission line ratios are most easily reproduced by models in which the stellar ionizing radiation field has Teff=50000-60000 K, gas-phase O/H in the range 0.2 < Z/Zsun < 1.0, and gas-phase N/O close to solar. Such high sustained Teff are not easily produced by standard population synthesis models, but are expected if massive binaries and/or rapid stellar rotation are important for the evolution of main sequence O-stars in typical high-redshift galaxies. We assess the applicability of commonly-used strong line indices for estimating gas-phase metallicities of high redshift galaxies, as well as their likely systematic biases. The empirical correlation between M* and inferred metallicity (the "MZR") at z~2.3 is as tight as for local galaxy samples, but is offset to lower metallicity (at all M*) by ~0.35 dex (abridged)},

	Abstract = {We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of $(106.5\,{\rm Mpc})^3$, has a dark mass resolution of ${6.26 \times 10^{6}\,{\rm M}_\odot}$, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of ${1.26 \times 10^{6}\,{\rm M}_\odot}$. At $z=0$ gravitational forces are softened on scales of $710\,{\rm pc}$, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of $48\,{\rm pc}$. We follow the dynamical evolution of $2\times 1820^3$ resolution elements and in addition passively evolve $1820^3$ Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than $18$ billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. At $z=0$ our simulation volume contains about $40,000$ well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at $z=0$. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disk galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {We determine an absolute calibration of the initial mass function (IMF) of early-type galaxies, by studying a sample of 56 gravitational lenses identified by the Sloan Lenses ACS Survey. Under the assumption of standard Navarro, Frenk, and White dark matter halos, a combination of lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis models is used to disentangle the stellar and dark matter contribution for each lens. We define an "IMF mismatch" parameter alpha≡M LD *,Ein/M SPS *,Ein as the ratio of stellar mass inferred by a joint lensing and dynamical model (M LD *,Ein) to the current stellar mass inferred from stellar populations synthesis models (M SPS *,Ein). We find that a Salpeter IMF provides stellar masses in agreement with those inferred by lensing and dynamical models (langlog alpharang = -0.00 $\pm$ 0.03 $\pm$ 0.02), while a Chabrier IMF underestimates them (langlog alpharang = 0.25 $\pm$ 0.03 $\pm$ 0.02). A tentative trend is found, in the sense that alpha appears to increase with galaxy velocity dispersion. Taken at face value, this result would imply a non-universal IMF, perhaps dependent on metallicity, age, or abundance ratios of the stellar populations. Alternatively, the observed trend may imply non-universal dark matter halos with inner density slope increasing with velocity dispersion. While the degeneracy between the two interpretations cannot be broken without additional information, the data imply that massive early-type galaxies cannot have both a universal IMF and universal dark matter halos.

	Abstract = {To investigate possible variations in the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in red-sequence galaxies, we have obtained infrared spectroscopy with Subaru/Fibre Multi-Object Spectrograph (FMOS) for a sample of 92 red-sequence galaxies in the Coma cluster. Velocity dispersions, ages and element abundances for these galaxies have been previously determined from optical data. The full range of velocity dispersions covered by the sample is sigma = 50-300  km s-1. By stacking the FMOS spectra in the rest frame and removing sky-subtraction residuals and other artefacts fixed in the observed frame, we derive composite spectra in the 9600-10500 {\AA} range for galaxies grouped according to their velocity dispersion or Mg/Fe ratio. We measure the Wing-Ford band of FeH and a new index centred on a Ca I line at 10345 {\AA}; these features are strong in cool dwarf stars, and hence reflect the form of the IMF at low mass (<0.5 M&sun;). The Ca I line, unlike the Wing-Ford band and other 'classical' IMF indicators (Na I doublet and Ca II triplet), is unaffected by the abundance of sodium. We compare the measured indices against predictions from spectral synthesis models matched to the element abundances estimated from the optical data. Binning galaxies by velocity dispersion, we find that both the Wing-Ford and Ca I index measurements are best reproduced by models with the Salpeter IMF. There is no clear evidence for an increase in dwarf-star content with velocity dispersion over the range probed by our sample (which includes few galaxies at the highest velocity dispersions, sigma > 250  km s-1). Binning the observed galaxies instead by Mg/Fe ratio, the behaviour of both indices implies a trend of IMF from Chabrier-like, at abundance ratios close to solar, to Salpeter or heavier for highly alpha-enhanced populations. At face value, this suggests that the IMF depends on the mode of star formation, with intense rapid starbursts generating a larger population of low-mass stars.

@article{Wegner12,
	Abstract = {We present new radially resolved spectroscopy of eight early-type galaxies in the A262 cluster. The measurements include stellar rotation, velocity dispersion, H 3 and H 4 coefficients of the line-of-sight velocity distribution along the major and minor axes and an intermediate axis as well as line-strength index profiles of Mg, Fe, and Hbeta. The ionized-gas velocity and velocity dispersion is measured for six sample galaxies along different axes. We derive dynamical mass-to-light ratios and dark matter densities from orbit-based dynamical models, complemented by the galaxies' ages, metallicities, and alpha-element abundances from single stellar-population models. The ionized-gas kinematics give a valuable consistency check for the model assumptions about orientation and intrinsic shape of the galaxies. Four galaxies have a significant detection of dark matter and their halos are about 10 times denser than in spirals of the same stellar mass. By calibrating dark matter densities to cosmological simulations we find assembly redshifts of z DM ≈ 1-3, as previously reported for the Coma Cluster. The dynamical mass that follows the light is larger than expected for a Kroupa stellar initial mass function (IMF), especially in galaxies with high velocity dispersion sigmaeff inside the effective radius r eff. This could indicate a "massive" IMF in massive galaxies. Alternatively, some of the dark matter in massive galaxies could follow the light very closely. In combination with our comparison sample of Coma early-type galaxies, we now have 5 of 24 galaxies where (1) mass follows light to 1-3 r eff, (2) the dynamical mass-to-light ratio of all the mass that follows the light is large (≈8-10 in the Kron-Cousins R band), and (3) the dark matter fraction is negligible to 1-3 r eff. Unless the IMF in these galaxies is particularly "massive" and somehow coupled to the dark matter content, there seems to be a significant degeneracy between luminous and dark matter in at least some early-type galaxies. The role of violent relaxation is briefly discussed.  Based on data collected with the 2.4 m Hiltner Telescope.},

@article{Napolitano09,
	Abstract = {We present new Planetary Nebula Spectrograph observations of the ordinary elliptical galaxy NGC 4494, resulting in positions and velocities of 255 planetary nebulae out to seven effective radii (25 kpc). We also present new wide-field surface photometry from MMT/Megacam, and long-slit stellar kinematics from VLT/FORS2. The spatial and kinematical distributions of the planetary nebulae agree with the field stars in the region of overlap. The mean rotation is relatively low, with a possible kinematic axis twist outside 1Re. The velocity dispersion profile declines with radius, though not very steeply, down to ~70kms-1 at the last data point.  We have constructed spherical dynamical models of the system, including Jeans analyses with multi-component Lambda cold dark matter (CDM) motivated galaxies as well as logarithmic potentials. These models include special attention to orbital anisotropy, which we constrain using fourth-order velocity moments. Given several different sets of modelling methods and assumptions, we find consistent results for the mass profile within the radial range constrained by the data. Some dark matter (DM) is required by the data; our best-fitting solution has a radially anisotropic stellar halo, a plausible stellar mass-to-light ratio and a DM halo with an unexpectedly low central density. We find that this result does not substantially change with a flattened axisymmetric model.  Taken together with other results for galaxy halo masses, we find suggestions for a puzzling pattern wherein most intermediate-luminosity galaxies have very low concentration haloes, while some high-mass ellipticals have very high concentrations. We discuss some possible implications of these results for DM and galaxy formation.},

@article{Napolitano11,
	Abstract = {As part of our current programme to test LambdaCDM predictions for dark matter (DM) haloes using extended kinematical observations of early-type galaxies, we present a dynamical analysis of the bright elliptical galaxy NGC 4374 (M84) based on ˜450 planetary nebulae (PNe) velocities from the PN.Spectrograph, along with extended long-slit stellar kinematics.  This is the first such analysis of a galaxy from our survey with a radially constant velocity dispersion profile. We find that the spatial and kinematical distributions of the PNe agree with the field stars in the region of overlap.  The velocity kurtosis is consistent with zero at almost all radii.  We construct a series of Jeans models, fitting both velocity dispersion and kurtosis to help break the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. Our mass models include DM haloes either with shallow cores or with central cusps as predicted by cosmological simulations - along with the novel introduction in this context of adiabatic halo contraction from baryon infall.  Both classes of models confirm a very massive dark halo around NGC 4374, demonstrating that PN kinematics data are well able to detect such haloes when present. Considering the default cosmological mass model, we confirm earlier suggestions that bright galaxies tend to have halo concentrations higher than LambdaCDM predictions, but this is found to be solved if either a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) or an adiabatic contraction with a Kroupa IMF is assumed. Thus for the first time a case is found where the PN dynamics may well be consistent with a standard dark matter halo. A cored halo can also fit the data, and prefers a stellar mass consistent with a Salpeter IMF. The less dramatic dark matter content found in lower-luminosity 'ordinary' ellipticals suggests a bimodality in the halo properties which may be produced by divergent baryonic effects during their assembly histories.

	Abstract = {We determine an absolute calibration of stellar mass-to-light ratios for the densest ~=3 per cent of early-type galaxies in the local Universe (redshift z~= 0.08) from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. This sample of ˜4000 galaxies has, assuming a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), effective stellar surface densities Sigmae > 2500 M&sun; pc-2, stellar population synthesis (SPS) stellar masses log10(MSPS/M&sun;) < 10.8 and aperture velocity dispersions of ? (68 per cent range). In contrast to typical early-type galaxies, we show that these dense early-type galaxies follow the virial Fundamental Plane, which suggests that mass follows light. With the additional assumption that any dark matter does not follow the light, the dynamical masses of dense galaxies provide a direct measurement of stellar masses. Our dynamical masses (Mdyn), obtained from the spherical Jeans equations, are only weakly sensitive to the choice of anisotropy (beta) due to the relatively large aperture of the SDSS fibre for these galaxies: Rap~= 1.5Re. Assuming isotropic orbits (beta= 0), we find a median log10(Mdyn/MSPS) = 0.233 $\pm$ 0.003, consistent with a Salpeter IMF, while more bottom-heavy IMFs and standard Milky Way IMFs are strongly disfavoured. Our results are consistent with, but do not require, a dependence of the IMF on dynamical mass or velocity dispersion. We find evidence for a colour dependence to the IMF such that redder galaxies have heavier IMFs with Mdyn/MSPS∝ (g-r)1.13 $\pm$ 0.09. This may reflect a more fundamental dependence of the IMF on the age or metallicity of a stellar population, or the density at which the stars formed.},

	Abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

	Abstract = {We perform a spectroscopic study to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by using a large sample of 24 781 early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-based Spheroids Panchromatic Investigation in Different Environmental Regions survey. Clear evidence is found of a trend between IMF and central velocity dispersion (sigma0), evolving from a standard Kroupa/Chabrier IMF at sigma0 ˜ 100 km s-1 towards a more bottom-heavy IMF with increasing sigma0, becoming steeper than the Salpeter function at sigma0 ≳ 220 km s-1. We analyse a variety of spectral indices, combining gravity-sensitive features, with age- and metallicity-sensitive indices, and we also consider the effect of non-solar abundance variations. The indices, corrected to solar scale by means of semi-empirical correlations, are fitted simultaneously with the (nearly solar-scaled) extended MILES (MIUSCAT) stellar population models. Similar conclusions are reached when analysing the spectra with a hybrid approach, combining constraints from direct spectral fitting in the optical with those from IMF-sensitive indices. Our analysis suggests that sigma0, rather than [alpha/Fe], drives the variation of the IMF. Although our analysis cannot discriminate between a single power-law (unimodal) IMF and a low-mass (≲0.5 M&sun;) tapered (bimodal) IMF, robust constraints can be inferred for the fraction in low-mass stars at birth. This fraction (by mass) is found to increase from ˜20 per cent at sigma0 ˜ 100 km s-1, up to ˜80 per cent at sigma0 ˜ 300 km s-1. However, additional constraints can be provided with stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios: unimodal models predict M/L significantly larger than dynamical M/L, across the whole sigma0 range, whereas a bimodal IMF is compatible. Our results are robust against individual abundance variations. No significant variation is found in Na and Ca in addition to the expected change from the correlation between [alpha/Fe] and sigma0.},

@article{Spiniello12,
	Abstract = {We measure equivalent widths (EWs)---focusing on two unique features (NaI and TiO2) of low-mass stars (lsim 0.3 M &sun;)---for luminous red galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and X-Shooter Lens Survey (XLENS) in order to study the low-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). We compare these EWs to those derived from simple stellar population models computed with different IMFs, ages, [alpha/Fe], and elemental abundances. We find that models are able to simultaneously reproduce the observed NaD lambda5895 and Na I lambda8190 features for lower-mass (~sigma*) early-type galaxies (ETGs) but deviate increasingly for more massive ETGs, due to strongly mismatching NaD EWs. The TiO2 lambda6230 and the Na I lambda8190 features together appear to be a powerful IMF diagnostic, with age and metallicity effects orthogonal to the effect of IMF. We find that both features correlate strongly with galaxy velocity dispersion. The XLENS ETG (SDSS J0912+0029) and an SDSS ETG (SDSS J0041-0914) appear to require both an extreme dwarf-rich IMF and a high sodium enhancement ([Na/Fe] = +0.4). In addition, lensing constraints on the total mass of the XLENS system within its Einstein radius limit a bottom-heavy IMF with a power-law slope to x <= 3.0 at the 90% CL. We conclude that NaI and TiO features, in comparison with state-of-the-art simple stellar population models, suggest a mildly steepening IMF from Salpeter (dn/dm vprop m -x  with x = 2.35) to x ≈ 3.0 for ETGs in the range sigma = 200-335 km s-1.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the optical spectral region of spectra of ˜1000 stars searching for initial mass function (IMF)-sensitive features to constrain the low-mass end of the IMF slope in elliptical galaxies. The use of indicators bluer than near-infrared features (NaI, CaT, Wing-Ford FeH) is crucial if we want to compare our observations to optical simple stellar population (SSP) models. We use the MILES stellar library (S{\'a}nchez-Bl{\'a}zquez et al.) in the wavelength range 3500-7500 {\AA} to select indices that are sensitive to cool dwarf stars and that do not or only weakly depend on age and metallicity. We find several promising indices of molecular TiO and CaH lines. In this wavelength range, the response of a change in the effective temperature of the cool red giant (RGB) population is similar to the response of a change in the number of dwarf stars in the galaxy. We therefore investigate the degeneracy between IMF variation and DeltaTeff, RGB, and show that it is possible to break this degeneracy with the new IMF indicators defined here. In particular, we define a CaH1 index around lambda6380 {\AA} that arises purely from cool dwarfs, does not strongly depend on age and is anticorrelated with [alpha/Fe]. This index allows the determination of the low-mass end of the IMF slope from integrated-light measurements when combined with different TiO lines and age- and metallicity-dependent features such as Hbeta, Mgb, Fe5270 and Fe5335. The use of several indicators is crucial to break degeneracies between IMF variations, age, abundance pattern and effective temperature of the cool red giant (RGB) population. We measure line-index strengths of our new optical IMF indicators in the Conroy & van Dokkum SSP models and compare these with index strengths of the same spectral features in a sample of stacked Sloan Digital Sky Survey early-type galaxy spectra with varying velocity dispersions. Using different indicators, we find a clear trend of a steepening IMF with increasing velocity dispersion from 150 to 310 km s-1 described by the linear equation x = (2.3 $\pm$ 0.1) log sigma200 + (2.13 $\pm$ 0.15), where x is the IMF slope and sigma200 is the central stellar velocity dispersion measured in units of 200 km s-1. We test the robustness of this relation by repeating the analysis with 10 different sets of indicators. We found that the NaD feature has the largest impact on the IMF slope, if we assume solar [Na/Fe] abundance. By including NaD, the slope of the linear relation increases by 0.3 (2.6 $\pm$ 0.2). We compute the `IMF mismatch' parameter as the ratio of stellar mass-to-light ratio predicted from the x-sigma200 relation to that inferred from SSP models assuming a Salpeter IMF and find good agreement with independent published results.},

@article{Ferreras13,
	Abstract = {An essential component of galaxy formation theory is the stellar initial mass function (IMF) that describes the parent distribution of stellar mass in star-forming regions. We present observational evidence in a sample of early-type galaxies (ETGs) of a tight correlation between central velocity dispersion and the strength of several absorption features sensitive to the presence of low-mass stars. Our sample comprises ˜40 000 ETGs from the Spheroids Panchromatic Investigation in Different Environmental Regions survey (z ≲ 0.1). The data - extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey - are combined, rejecting both noisy data, and spectra with contamination from telluric lines, resulting in a set of 18 stacked spectra at high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ≳ 400 {\AA}-1). A combined analysis of IMF-sensitive line strengths and spectral fitting is performed with the latest state-of-the-art population synthesis models (an extended version of the MILES models). A significant trend is found between IMF slope and velocity dispersion, towards an excess of low-mass stars in the most massive galaxies. Although we emphasize that accurate values of the IMF slope will require a detailed analysis of chemical composition (such as [alpha/Fe] or even individual element abundance ratios), the observed trends suggest that low-mass ETGs are better fitted by a Kroupa-like IMF, whereas massive galaxies require bottom-heavy IMFs, exceeding the Salpeter slope at sigma ≳ 200 km s-1.},

@article{Sonnenfeld12,
	Abstract = {Stars and dark matter account for most of the mass of early-type galaxies, but uncertainties in the stellar population and the dark matter profile make it challenging to distinguish between the two components. Nevertheless, precise observations of stellar and dark matter are extremely valuable for testing the many models of structure formation and evolution. We present a measurement of the stellar mass and inner slope of the dark matter halo of a massive early-type galaxy at z = 0.222. The galaxy is the foreground deflector of the double Einstein ring gravitational lens system SDSSJ0946+1006, also known as the "Jackpot." By combining the tools of lensing and dynamics we first constrain the mean slope of the total mass density profile (\rho _{tot}\propto r^{-\gamma ^{\prime }}) within the radius of the outer ring to be gamma' = 1.98 $\pm$ 0.02 $\pm$ 0.01. Then we obtain a bulge-halo decomposition, assuming a power-law form for the dark matter halo. Our analysis yields gammaDM = 1.7 $\pm$ 0.2 for the inner slope of the dark matter profile, in agreement with theoretical findings on the distribution of dark matter in ellipticals, and a stellar mass from lensing and dynamics M LD * = 5.5-1.3 +0.4 × 1011 M &sun;. By comparing this measurement with stellar masses inferred from stellar population synthesis fitting we find that a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) provides a good description of the stellar population of the lens while the probability of the IMF being heavier than Chabrier is 95%. Our data suggest that growth by accretion of small systems from a compact red nugget is a plausible formation scenario for this object.},

We have upgraded our code by implementing the latest set of stellar evolution models of the Geneva group and the model atmosphere grid compiled by Lejeune et al. Several predictions which were not included in the previous publication are shown here for the first time. The models are presented in a homogeneous way for five metallicities between Z=0.040 and 0.001 and three choices of the initial mass function. The age coverage is 10^6-10^9 yr. We also show the spectral energy distributions which are used to compute colors and other quantities. The full data set is available for retrieval at a Web site, which allows users to run specific models with nonstandard parameters as well. We also make the source code available to the community.},

@article{van-Dokkum10,
	Abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the mass distribution of stars at the time of their formation and is of fundamental importance for many areas of astrophysics. The IMF is reasonably well constrained in the disk of the Milky Way but we have very little direct information on the form of the IMF in other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. Here we report observations of the NaI doublet and the Wing-Ford molecular FeH band in the spectra of elliptical galaxies. These lines are strong in stars with masses less than 0.3Msolar (where Msolar is the mass of the Sun) and are weak or absent in all other types of stars. We unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previous studies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. The direct detection of the light of low-mass stars implies that they are very abundant in elliptical galaxies, making up over 80% of the total number of stars and contributing more than 60% of the total stellar mass. We infer that the IMF in massive star-forming galaxies in the early Universe produced many more low-mass stars than the IMF in the Milky Way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than the Salpeter form in the mass range 0.1Msolar to 1Msolar.},

Here we discuss the structural, kinematical and dynamical properties. From the photometry we find that intrinsically more flattened discs tend to have a lower face-on central surface brightness and a larger dynamical mass-to-light ratio. This observation suggests that, at a constant maximum rotational velocity, lower surface brightness discs have smaller vertical stellar velocity dispersions.  Although the individual uncertainties are large, we find from the dynamical modelling that at least 12 discs are submaximal. The average disc contributes 53 +/- 4 per cent to the observed rotation at 2.2 disc scalelengths (hR), with a 1sigma scatter of 15 per cent. This percentage becomes somewhat lower when effects of finite disc flattening and gravity by the dark halo and the gas are taken into account. Since boxy and peanut-shaped bulges are probably associated with bars, the result suggests that at 2.2hR the submaximal nature of discs is independent of barredness. The possibility remains that very high surface brightness discs are maximal, as these discs are underrepresented in our sample. We confirm that the radial stellar disc velocity dispersion is related to the galaxy maximum rotational velocity. The scatter in this sigma versus vmax relation appears to correlate with the disc flattening, face-on central surface brightness and dynamical mass-to-light ratio. Low surface brightness discs tend to be more flattened and have smaller stellar velocity dispersions. The findings are consistent with the observed correlation between disc flattening and dynamical mass-to-light ratio and can generally be reproduced by the simple collapse theory for disc galaxy formation. Finally, the disc mass Tully-Fisher relation is offset from the maximum-disc scaled stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation of the Ursa Major cluster. This offset, -0.3 dex in mass, is naturally explained if the discs of the Ursa Major cluster spirals are submaximal.},

@article{Weiner01,
	Abstract = {We report a dynamical determination of the separate contributions of disk and dark halo masses to the rotation curve of a spiral galaxy. We use fluid-dynamical models of gas flow in the barred galaxy NGC 4123 to constrain the dynamical properties of the galaxy: disk M/L, bar pattern speed, and the central density and scale radius of the dark halo. We derive a realistic barred potential directly from the light distribution. For each model we assume a value of the stellar M/L and a bar pattern speed Omegap and add a dark halo to fit the rotation curve. We then compute the gas flow velocities with a two-dimensional gasdynamical code and compare the model flow patterns to a two-dimensional velocity field derived from Fabry-Perot observations. The strong shocks and noncircular motions in the observed gas flow require a high stellar M/L and a fast-rotating bar. Models with I-band disk M/L of 2.0-2.5 h75, or 80%-100% of the maximum disk value, are highly favored. The corotation radius of the bar must be <=1.5 times the bar semimajor axis. These results contradict some recent claimed ``universal'' galaxy disk/halo relations, since NGC 4123 is of modest size (rotation curve maximum 145 km s-1 and Vflat=130 km s-1) yet quite disk-dominated. The dark halo of NGC 4123 is less concentrated than favored by current models of dark halos based on cosmological simulations. Since some 30% of bright disk galaxies are strongly barred and have dust lanes indicating shock morphology similar to that of NGC 4123, it is likely that they also have high stellar M/L and low-density halos. We suggest that luminous matter dominates inside the optical radius R25 of high surface brightness disk galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the mass-to-light ratios of stellar populations as predicted by stellar population synthesis codes and compare those to dynamical/gravitational measurements. In Bell & de Jong (2001) we showed that population synthesis models predict a tight relation between the color and mass-to-light ratio of a stellar population. The normalization of this relation depends critically on the shape of the stellar IMF at the low-mass end. These faint stars contribute significantly to the mass, but insignificantly to the luminosity and color of a stellar system. In Bell & de Jong (2001) we used rotation curves to normalize the relation, but rotation curves provide only an upper limit to the stellar masses in a system. Here we compare stellar and dynamical masses for a range of stellar systems in order to constrain the mass normalization of stellar population models. We find that the normalization of Bell & de Jong (2001) should be lowered by about 0.05-0.1 dex in M/L. This is consistent with a Kroupa (2001), Chabrier (2003), or a Kennicutt (1983) IMF, but does not leave much room for other unseen components.},

@article{Padmanabhan04,
	Abstract = {We study the variation of the dark matter mass fraction of elliptical galaxies as a function of their luminosity, stellar mass, and size using a sample of 29,469 elliptical galaxies culled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We model ellipticals as a stellar Hernquist profile embedded in an adiabatically compressed dark matter halo. This model allows us to estimate a dynamical mass ( Mdynm) at the half-light radius from the velocity dispersion of the spectra, and to compare these to the stellar mass estimates ( M*) from Kauffmann et al. [MNRAS 341 (2003) 33]. We find that M*/ L is independent of luminosity, while Mdynm/ L increases with luminosity, implying that the dark matter fraction increases with luminosity. We also observe that at a fixed luminosity or stellar mass, the dark matter fraction increases with increasing galaxy size or, equivalently, increases with decreasing surface brightness: high surface brightness galaxies show almost no evidence for dark matter, while in low surface brightness galaxies, the dark matter exceeds the stellar mass at the half-light radius. We relate this to the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies, suggesting that the tilt of this plane from simple virial predictions is due to the dark matter in galaxies. We find that a simple model where galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos and have a star formation efficiency independent of their surface brightness explains these trends. We estimate the virial mass of ellipticals as being approximately 7-30 times their stellar mass, with the lower limit suggesting almost all of the gas within the virial radius is converted into stars.},

@article{Zaritsky06,
	Abstract = {We present a unifying empirical description of the structural and kinematic properties of all spheroids embedded in dark matter halos. We find that the intracluster stellar spheroidal components of galaxy clusters, which we call cluster spheroids (CSphs) and which are typically 100 times the size of normal elliptical galaxies, lie on a ``fundamental plane'' as tight as that defined by elliptical galaxies (rms in effective radius of ~0.07) but having a different slope. The slope, as measured by the coefficient of the logsigma term, declines significantly and systematically between the fundamental planes of ellipticals, brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), and CSphs. We attribute this decline primarily to a continuous change in Me/Le, the mass-to-light ratio within the effective radius re, with spheroid scale. The magnitude of the slope change requires that it arise principally from differences in the relative distributions of luminous and dark matter, rather than from stellar population differences such as in age and metallicity. By expressing the Me/Le term as a function of sigma in the simple derivation of the fundamental plane and requiring the behavior of that term to mimic the observed nonlinear relationship between logMe/Le and logsigma, we simultaneously fit a two-dimensional manifold to the measured properties of dwarf elliptical and elliptical galaxies, BCGs, and CSphs. The combined data have an rms scatter in logre of 0.114 (0.099 for the combination of ellipticals, BCGs, and CSphs), which is modestly larger than each fundamental plane has alone, but which includes the scatter introduced by merging different studies done in different filters by different investigators. This ``fundamental manifold'' fits the structural and kinematic properties of spheroids that span a factor of 100 in sigma and 1000 in re. While our mathematical form is neither unique nor derived from physical principles, the tightness of the fit leaves little room for improvement by other unification schemes over the range of observed spheroids.},

@article{Gerhard01,
	Abstract = {Based on a uniform dynamical analysis of the line-profile shapes of 21 mostly luminous, slowly rotating, and nearly round elliptical galaxies, we have investigated the dynamical family relations and dark halo properties of ellipticals. Our results include: (i) The circular velocity curves (CVCs) of elliptical galaxies are flat to within ~=10% for R>~0.2Re. (ii) Most ellipticals are moderately radially anisotropic; their dynamical structure is surprisingly uniform. (iii) Elliptical galaxies follow a Tully-Fisher (TF) relation with marginally shallower slope than spiral galaxies, and vmaxc~=300 km s-1 for an L*B galaxy. At given circular velocity, they are ~1 mag fainter in B and ~0.6 mag in R and appear to have slightly lower baryonic mass than spirals, even for the maximum M/LB allowed by the kinematics. (iv) The luminosity dependence of M/LB indicated by the tilt of the fundamental plane (FP) is confirmed. The tilt of the FP is not caused by dynamical or photometric nonhomology, although the latter might influence the slope of M/L versus L. It can also not be due only to an increasing dark matter fraction with L for the range of IMF currently discussed. It is, however, consistent with stellar population models based on published metallicities and ages. The main driver is therefore probably metallicity, and a secondary population effect is needed to explain the K-band tilt. (v) These results make it likely that elliptical galaxies have nearly maximal M/LB (minimal halos). (vi) Despite the uniformly flat CVCs, there is a spread in the luminous to dark matter ratio and in cumulative M/LB(r). Some galaxies have no indication for dark matter within 2Re, whereas for others we obtain local M/LB-values of 20-30 at 2Re. (vii) In models with maximum stellar mass, the dark matter contributes ~10%-40% of the mass within Re. Equal interior mass of dark and luminous matter is predicted at ~2-4Re. (viii) Even in these maximum stellar mass models, the halo core densities and phase-space densities are at least ~25 times larger and the halo core radii ~4 times smaller than in spiral galaxies of the same circular velocity. The increase in M/L sets in at ~10 times larger acceleration than in spirals. This could imply that elliptical galaxy halos collapsed at high redshifts or that some of the dark matter in ellipticals might be baryonic.},

	Abstract = {We present a joint gravitational lensing and stellar-dynamical analysis of 15 massive field early-type galaxies selected from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey. The following numerical results are found: (1) A joint likelihood gives an average logarithmic density slope for the total mass density of <gamma'>=2.01+0.02-0.03 (68% CL; rhotot~r-gamma') inside <REinst>=4.2+/-0.4 kpc (rms of 1.6 kpc) for isotropic models. The inferred intrinsic rms spread in logarithmic density slopes is sigmagamma'=0.12. (2) The average position-angle difference between the light distribution and the total mass distribution is found to be <Deltatheta>=0deg+/-3deg (rms of 10$\,^{\circ}$), setting an upper limit of <gammaext><~0.035 on the average external shear. The total mass has an average ellipticity <qSIE>=0.78+/-0.03 (rms of 0.12), which correlates extremely well with the stellar ellipticity, q*, resulting in <qSIE/q*>=0.99+/-0.03 (rms of 0.11) for sigma>~225 km s-1 omitting three S0 lens galaxies. (3) The average projected dark matter mass fraction is inferred to be <fDM>=0.25+/-0.06 (rms of 0.22) inside <REinst>, using the stellar mass-to-light ratios derived from the fundamental plane as priors. (4) Combined with results from the Lenses Structure and Dynamics (LSD) Survey at z>~0.3, we find no significant evolution of the total density slope inside one effective radius for galaxies with sigmaap>=200 km s-1: a linear fit gives alphagamma'≡d<gamma'>/dz=0.23+/-0.16 (1 sigma) for the range z=0.08-1.01. The small scatter and absence of significant evolution in the inner density slopes suggest a collisional scenario in which gas and dark matter strongly couple during galaxy formation, leading to a total mass distribution that rapidly converges to dynamical isothermality.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the initial mass function and mass segregation in super star cluster M82-F with high-resolution Keck NIRSPEC echelle spectroscopy. Cross-correlation with template supergiant spectra provides the velocity dispersion of the cluster, enabling measurement of the kinematic (virial) mass of the cluster when combined with sizes from NICMOS and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) images. We find a mass of 6.6+/-0.9×105Msolar based on near-IR light and 7.0+/-1.2×105Msolar based on optical light. Using PSF-fitting photometry, we derive the cluster's light-to-mass (L/M) ratio in both near-IR and optical light and compare to population-synthesis models. The ratios are inconsistent with a normal stellar initial mass function for the adopted age of 40-60 Myr, suggesting a deficiency of low-mass stars within the volume sampled. King model light profile fits to new Hubble Space Telescope ACS images of M82-F, in combination with fits to archival near-IR images, indicate mass segregation in the cluster. As a result, the virial mass represents a lower limit on the mass of the cluster.  Based on observations made at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {I use recent photometric and stellar velocity dispersion measurements of the super-star clusters (SSCs) NGC 1569A and NGC 1705-1 to determine their present-day luminosity/mass ratios (L_V/M). I then use the inferred L_V/M, together with population synthesis models of evolving star clusters, to constrain the initial mass functions (IMFs) in these objects. I find that (L_V/M)_&sun; = 28.9 in 1569A and (L_V/M)_&sun; = 126 in 1705-1. It follows that in 1569A the IMF is steep with alpha ~ 2.5 for m^-alphadm IMFs that extend to 0.1 M_&sun;. This implies that most of the stellar mass in 1569A is contained in low-mass (<1 M_&sun;) stars; however, in 1705-1 the IMF is either flat, with alpha <~ 2, or it is truncated at a lower mass limit between 1 and 3 M_&sun;. I compare the inferred IMFs with the mass functions (MFs) of Galactic globular clusters. It appears that 1569A has a sufficient reservoir of low-mass stars for it plausibly to evolve into an object similar to Galactic globular clusters; however, the apparent deficiency of low-mass stars in 1705-1 may make it difficult for this SSC to become a globular cluster. If low-mass stars do dominate the cluster mass in 1705-1, the large L_V/M in this SSC may be evidence that the most massive stars have formed close to the cluster cores.},

	Abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars that form the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than ˜100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than ˜104M&sun;; the size of the cluster and its environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters. We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

@article{Smith01,
	Abstract = {We present high-dispersion echelle spectroscopy of the very luminous, young super star cluster (SSC) `F' in M82, obtained with the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope, for the purpose of deriving its dynamical mass and assessing whether it will survive to become an old globular cluster. In addition to the stellar lines, the spectrum contains complex Nai absorption and broad emission lines from the ionized gas. We measure a stellar velocity dispersion of 13.4+/-0.7kms-1 and a projected half-light radius of 2.8+/-0.3pc from archival HST/WFPC2 images, and derive a dynamical mass of 1.2+/-0.1×106Msolar, demonstrating that M82-F is a very massive, compact cluster. We determine that the current luminosity-to-mass ratio (LV/M)solar for M82-F is 45+/-13. Comparison with spectral synthesis models shows that (LV/M)solar is a factor of ~5 higher than that predicted for a standard Kroupa initial mass function (IMF) at the well-determined age for M82-F of 60+/-20Myr. This high value of (LV/M)solar indicates a deficit of low-mass stars in M82-F; the current mass function (MF) evidently is `top-heavy'. We find that a lower mass cut-off of 2-3Msolar is required to match the observations for a MF with a slope alpha=2.3. Since the cluster apparently lacks long-lived low-mass stars, it will not become an old globular cluster, but probably will dissolve at an age of <= 2Gyr. We also derive updated luminosity-to-mass ratios for the younger SSCs NGC 1569A and 1705-1. For the first object, the observations are consistent with a slightly steeper MF (alpha=2.5), whereas for NGC 1705-1 the observed ratio requires the MF to be truncated near 2Msolar for a slope of alpha=2.3. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of large-scale IMF variations; with the present data the top-heavy MF could reflect a local mass segregation effect during the birth of the cluster. M82-F probably formed in a dense molecular cloud; however, its high radial velocity with respect to the centre of M82 (~-175kms-1) suggests that it is on an eccentric orbit and now far from its birthplace, so the environment of its formation is unknown.},

@article{Thomas11,
	Abstract = {This work aims to study the distribution of the luminous and dark matter in Coma early-type galaxies. Dynamical masses obtained under the assumption that mass follows light do not match with the masses of strong gravitational lens systems of similar velocity dispersions. Instead, dynamical fits with dark matter haloes are in good agreement with lensing results. We derive mass-to-light ratios of the stellar populations from Lick absorption line indices, reproducing well the observed galaxy colours. Even in dynamical models with dark matter haloes the amount of mass that follows the light increases more rapidly with the galaxy velocity dispersion than expected for a constant stellar initial mass function (IMF). While galaxies around sigmaeff≈ 200 km s-1 are consistent with a Kroupa IMF, the same IMF underpredicts luminous dynamical masses of galaxies with sigmaeff≈ 300 km s-1 by a factor of 2 and more. A systematic variation in the stellar IMF with the galaxy velocity dispersion could explain this trend with a Salpeter IMF for the most massive galaxies. If the IMF is instead constant, then some of the dark matter in high-velocity-dispersion galaxies must follow a spatial distribution very similar to that of the light. A combination of both, a varying IMF and a component of dark matter that follows the light is possible as well. For a subsample of galaxies with old stellar populations, we show that the tilt in the Fundamental Plane can be explained by systematic variations of the total (stellar + dark) mass inside the effective radius. We tested commonly used mass estimator formulae, finding them accurate at the 20-30 per cent level.},

@article{Wolf10,
	Abstract = {We derive an accurate mass estimator for dispersion-supported stellar systems and demonstrate its validity by analysing resolved line-of-sight velocity data for globular clusters, dwarf galaxies and elliptical galaxies. Specifically, by manipulating the spherical Jeans equation we show that the mass enclosed within the 3D deprojected half-light radius r1/2 can be determined with only mild assumptions about the spatial variation of the stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy as long as the projected velocity dispersion profile is fairly flat near the half-light radius, as is typically observed. We find M1/2 = 3 G-1< sigma2los > r1/2 ~= 4 G-1< sigma2los > Re, where < sigma2los > is the luminosity-weighted square of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and Re is the 2D projected half-light radius. While deceptively familiar in form, this formula is not the virial theorem, which cannot be used to determine accurate masses unless the radial profile of the total mass is known a priori. We utilize this finding to show that all of the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (MW dSphs) are consistent with having formed within a halo of a mass of approximately 3 × 109 Msolar, assuming a Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. The faintest MW dSphs seem to have formed in dark matter haloes that are at least as massive as those of the brightest MW dSphs, despite the almost five orders of magnitude spread in luminosity between them. We expand our analysis to the full range of observed dispersion-supported stellar systems and examine their dynamical I-band mass-to-light ratios UpsilonI1/2. The UpsilonI1/2 versus M1/2 relation for dispersion-supported galaxies follows a U shape, with a broad minimum near UpsilonI1/2 ~= 3 that spans dwarf elliptical galaxies to normal ellipticals, a steep rise to UpsilonI1/2 ~= 3200 for ultra-faint dSphs and a more shallow rise to UpsilonI1/2 ~= 800 for galaxy cluster spheroids.},

@article{Trujillo04,
	Abstract = {The variation of the mass-to-light M/L ratios of early-type galaxies as a function of their luminosities L is investigated. It is shown that the tilt beta=0.27 (in the B band) of the fundamental plane relation M/L~Lbeta can be understood as a combination of two effects: about one-quarter (i.e., Deltabeta=0.07) is a result of systematic variations of the stellar population properties with increasing luminosity. The remaining three-quarters (i.e., Deltabeta=0.2) can be completely attributed to nonhomology effects that lead to a systematic change of the surface brightness profiles with increasing luminosity. Consequently, the observed tilt in the K band (beta=0.17), where stellar population effects are negligible, is explained by nonhomology effects alone. After correcting for nonhomology, the mean value of the mass-to-light ratio of elliptical galaxies (M/LB) is 7.1+/-2.8 (1 sigma scatter).},

@article{Dutton13a,
	Abstract = {Recent work has suggested that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is not universal, but rather is correlated with galaxy stellar mass, stellar velocity dispersion or morphological type. In this paper, we investigate variations of the IMF within individual galaxies. For this purpose, we use strong lensing and gas kinematics to measure independently the normalization of the IMF of the bulge and disc components of a sample of five massive spiral galaxies with substantial bulge components taken from the Sloan WFC Edge-on Late-type Lens Survey (SWELLS). We find that the stellar masses of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematic data. A comparison with masses based on stellar population synthesis models fitted to optical and near-infrared photometry favours a Salpeter-like normalization of the IMF. Conversely, the disc masses are less well constrained due to degeneracies with the dark matter halo, but are consistent with Milky Way-type IMFs in agreement with previous studies. The discs are submaximal at 2.2 disc scale lengths, but due to the contribution of the bulges, the galaxies are baryon dominated at 2.2 disc scale lengths. Globally, our inferred IMF normalization is consistent with that found for early-type galaxies of comparable stellar mass (>1011 M&sun;). Our results suggest a non-universal IMF within the different components of spiral galaxies, adding to the well-known differences in stellar populations between discs and bulges.},

We find that the observed stellar mass-velocity dispersion relation is steeper than expected assuming MOND with a fixed stellar initial mass function (IMF) and a standard value for the acceleration parameter a0. Turning from the space of observables to model space (a) fixing the IMF, a universal value for a0 cannot be fitted, while, (b) fixing a0 and leaving the IMF free to vary, we find that it is `lighter' (Chabrier like) for low-dispersion galaxies and `heavier' (Salpeter like) for high dispersions. This MOND-based trend matches inferences from Newtonian dynamics with DM and from the detailed analysis of spectral absorption lines, adding to the converging lines of evidence for a systematically varying IMF.},

	Abstract = {We present an F606W-F814W color-magnitude diagram for the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy based on HST Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) images. The luminosity function is well sampled to 3 mag below the turnoff. We see no evidence for multiple turnoffs and conclude that, at least over the field of view of the WFPC2, star formation was primarily single-epoch. If the observed number of blue stragglers is due to extended star formation, then roughly 6 percent (upper limit) of the stars could be half as old as the bulk of the galaxy. The color difference between the red giant branch and the turnoff is consistent with an old population and is very similar to that observed in the old, metal-poor Galactic globular clusters M68 and M92. Despite its red horizontal branch, Draco appears to be older than M68 and M92 by 1.6 +/- 2.5 Gyr, lending support to the argument that the 'second parameter' that governs horizontal-branch morphology must be something other than age. Draco's observed luminosity function is very similar to that of M68, and the derived initial mass function is consistent with that of the solar neighborhood.},

@article{Kalirai13,
	Abstract = {We present a new measurement of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) based on ultra-deep, high-resolution photometry of >5000 stars in the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys observations reveal this rich, cospatial population behind the foreground globular cluster 47 Tuc, which we targeted for 121 HST orbits. The stellar main sequence of the SMC is measured in the F606W, F814W color-magnitude diagram down to ~30th magnitude, and is cleanly separated from the foreground star cluster population using proper motions. We simulate the SMC population by extracting stellar masses (single and unresolved binaries) from specific IMFs and converting those masses to luminosities in our bandpasses. The corresponding photometry for these simulated stars is drawn directly from a rich cloud of 4 million artificial stars, thereby accounting for the real photometric scatter and completeness of the data. Over a continuous and well-populated mass range of M = 0.37-0.93 M &sun; (e.g., down to a ~75% completeness limit at F606W = 28.7), we demonstrate that the IMF is well represented by a single power-law form with slope alpha = -1.90 (+0.15 -0.10) (3sigma error) (e.g., dN/dMvprop M alpha). This is shallower than the Salpeter slope of alpha = -2.35, which agrees with the observed stellar luminosity function at higher masses. Our results indicate that the IMF does not turn over to a more shallow power-law form within this mass range. We discuss implications of this result for the theory of star formation, the inferred masses of galaxies, and the (lack of a) variation of the IMF with metallicity.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with proposal GO-11677.},

	Abstract = {The stellar initial mass function at high redshift is an important defining property of the first stellar systems to form and may also play a role in various dark matter problems. We here determine the faint stellar luminosity function in an apparently dark-matter-dominated external galaxy in which the stars formed at high redshift. The Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is a system with a particularly simple stellar population---all of the stars being old and metal-poor---similar to that of a classical halo globular cluster. A direct comparison of the faint luminosity functions of the UMi dSph and of similar metallicity, old globular clusters is equivalent to a comparison of the initial mass functions and is presented here, based on deep HST WFPC2 and STIS imaging data. We find that these luminosity functions are indistinguishable, down to a luminosity corresponding to ˜0.3 M &sun;. Our results show that the low-mass stellar IMF for stars that formed at very high redshift is apparently invariant across environments as diverse as those of an extremely low-surface-brightness, dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy and a dark-matter-free, high-density globular cluster within the Milky Way.},

@article{Espinoza09,
	Abstract = {The massive Arches cluster near the Galactic center should be an ideal laboratory for investigating massive star formation under extreme conditions. But it comes at a high price: the cluster is hidden behind several tens of magnitudes of visual extinction. Severe crowding requires space or AO-assisted instruments to resolve the stellar populations, and even with the best instruments interpreting the data is far from direct. Several investigations using NICMOS and the most advanced AO imagers on the ground revealed an overall top-heavy IMF for the cluster, with a very flat IMF near the center. There are several effects, however, that could potentially bias these results, in particular the strong differential extinction and the problem of transforming the observations into a standard photometric system in the presence of strong reddening. We present new observations obtained with the NAOS-Conica (NACO) AO-imager on the VLT. The problem of photometric transformation is avoided by working in the natural photometric system of NACO, and we use a Bayesian approach to determine masses and reddenings from the broad-band IR colors. A global value of Gamma = -1.1 $\pm$ 0.2 for the high-mass end (M > 10 M&sun;) of the IMF is obtained, and we conclude that a power law of Salpeter slope cannot be discarded for the Arches cluster. The flattening of the IMF towards the center is confirmed, but is less severe than previously thought. We find Gamma = -0.88 $\pm$ 0.20, which is incompatible with previous determinations. Within 0.4 pc we derive a total mass of ~2.0($\pm$0.6) × 104 M&sun; for the cluster and a central mass density rho = 2($\pm$0.4) × 105 M&sun; pc-3 that confirms Arches as the densest known young massive cluster in the Milky Way.

	Abstract = {Accurate luminosity functions (LFs) for a dozen globular clusters have now been measured at or just beyond their half-light radius using HST. They span almost the entire cluster main sequence (MS) below 0.75 Msolar. All these clusters exhibit LFs that rise continuously from an absolute I magnitude MI~=6 to a peak at MI~=8.5-9 and then drop with increasing MI. Transformation of the LFs into mass functions (MFs) by means of mass-luminosity (ML) relations that are consistent with all presently available data on the physical properties of low-mass, low-metallicity stars shows that all the LFs observed so far can be obtained from MFs having the shape of a lognormal distribution with characteristic mass mc=0.33+/-0.03 Msolar and standard deviation sigma=0.34+/-0.04. In particular, the LFs of the four clusters in the sample that extend well beyond the peak luminosity down to close to the hydrogen-burning limit (NGC 6341, NGC 6397, NGC 6752, and NGC 6809) can only be reproduced by such distributions and not by a single power law in the 0.1-0.6 Msolar range. After correction for the effects of mass segregation, the variation of the ratio of the number of higher to lower mass stars with cluster mass or any simple orbital parameter or the expected time to disruption recently computed for these clusters shows no statistically significant trend over a range of this last parameter of more than a factor of ~100. We conclude that the global MFs of these clusters have not been measurably modified by evaporation and tidal interactions with the Galaxy and, thus, should reflect the initial distribution of stellar masses. Since the lognormal function that we find is also very similar to the one obtained independently for much younger clusters and to the form expected theoretically, the implication seems to be unavoidable that it represents the true stellar initial mass function for this type of star in this mass range. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We present results of a photometric survey whose aim was to derive structural and astrophysical parameters for 42 open clusters. While our sample is definitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy, it does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow for simple statistical considerations. Methods: BV wide-field CCD photometry was obtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical evolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were determined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and distances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass function was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation effect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. Results: This study reports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42 observed open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed clusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate. The core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is 3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's mass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical evolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is similar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of evaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass segregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the dynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log({age}) = 8. Low-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log({age}) = 8.5 and not younger than one relaxation time.  Tables 1-5 are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {We present wide-field deep {UBVI} photometry for the previously unstudied open cluster NGC 4852 down to a limiting magnitude I˜24, obtained from observations taken with the Wide Field Imager camera on-board the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope at La Silla (ESO, Chile). These data are used to obtain the first estimate of the cluster basic parameters, to study the cluster spatial extension by means of star counts, and to derive the Luminosity (LF) and Mass Function (MF). The cluster radius turns out to be 5.0$\pm$1.0 arcmin. The cluster emerges clearly from the field down to V=20 mag. At fainter magnitudes, it is completely confused with the general Galactic disk field. The stars inside this region define a young open cluster (200 million years old) 1.1 kpc far from the Sun (m-M = 11.60, E(B-V) = 0.45). The Present Day Mass Functions (PDMF) from the V photometry is one of the most extended in mass obtained to date, and can be represented as a power-law with a slope alpha = 2.3$\pm$0.3 and (the Salpeter MF in this notation has a slope alpha = 2.35), in the mass range 3.2 <= {m}/{m&sun;} <= 0.6. Below this mass, the MF cannot be considered as representative of the cluster MF, as the cluster merges with the field and therefore the MF is the result of the combined effect of strong irregularities in the stellar background and interaction of the cluster with the dense Galactic field. The cluster total mass at the limiting magnitude results to be 2570$\pm$210  M&sun;.},

	Abstract = {We measure the stellar mass surface densities of early type galaxies by observing the micro-lensing of macro-lensed quasars caused by individual stars, including stellar remnants, brown dwarfs and red dwarfs too faint to produce photometric or spectroscopic signatures. Instead of observing multiple micro-lensing events in a single system, we combine single epoch X-ray snapshots of ten quadruple systems, and compare the measured relative magnifications for the images with those computed from macro-models. We use these to normalize a stellar mass fundamental plane constructed using a Salpeter IMF with a low mass cutoff of 0.1 solar mass and treat the zeropoint of the surface mass density as a free parameter. Our method measures the graininess of the gravitational potential produced by individual stars, in contrast to methods that decompose a smooth total gravitational potential into two smooth components, one stellar and one dark. We find the median likelihood value for the normalization factor F by which the Salpeter stellar masses must be multiplied is 1.52, with a one sigma confidence range, dominated by small number statistics, of 0.92 < F < 2.50.},

	Abstract = {The spectral absorption lines in early-type galaxies contain a wealth of information regarding the detailed abundance pattern, star formation history, and stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the underlying stellar population. Using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect of variable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high quality absorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of M31. These data extend to 1 mum and they therefore include the IMF-sensitive spectral features Na I, Ca II, and FeH at 0.82 mum, 0.86 mum, and 0.99 mum, respectively. The models fit the data well, with typical rms residuals <~ 1%. Strong constraints on the IMF and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (M/L)stars, are derived for individual galaxies. We find that the IMF becomes increasingly bottom-heavy with increasing velocity dispersion and [Mg/Fe]. At the lowest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF is consistent with the Milky Way (MW) IMF, while at the highest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF contains more low-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a Salpeter IMF. Our best-fit (M/L)stars values do not exceed dynamically based M/L values. We also apply our models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and find an (M/L)stars that implies fewer low-mass stars than a MW IMF, again agreeing with dynamical constraints. We discuss other possible explanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the IMF is the simplest and most plausible.},

	Abstract = {We present orbit-based dynamical models and stellar population analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey J151741.75-004217.6, a low-redshift (z = 0.116) early-type galaxy (ETG) which, for its moderate luminosity, has an exceptionally high velocity dispersion. We aim to determine the central black hole (BH) mass (M*), the i-band stellar mass-to-light ratio (Upsilon*, i) and the slope of the initial mass function (IMF). Combining constraints from Hubble Space Telescope imaging and long-slit kinematic data with those from fitting the spectrum with stellar populations models of varying IMFs, we show that this galaxy has a large fraction of low-mass stars, significantly higher than implied even by a Salpeter IMF. We exclude a Chabrier/Kroupa as well as a unimodal (i.e. single-segment) IMF, while a bimodal (low-mass tapered) shape is consistent with the dynamical constraints. Thereby, our study demonstrates that a very bottom-heavy IMF can exist even in an L* ETG. We place an upper limit of 1010.5 M&sun; on M*, which still leaves open the possibility of an extremely massive BH.},

	Abstract = {In the companion Paper XV of this series, we derive accurate total mass-to-light ratios (M/L)_JAM≈ (M/L)({r}= {R_e}) within a sphere of radius r= {R_e} centred on the galaxy, as well as stellar (M/L)stars (with the dark matter removed) for the volume-limited and nearly mass-selected (stellar mass M_star ≳ 6× 10^9 { M_{&sun;}}) ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs, ellipticals Es and lenticulars S0s). Here, we use those parameters to study the two orthogonal projections ({M_JAM}, {sigma _e}) and ({M_JAM}, {R_e^maj}) of the thin Mass Plane (MP) ({M_JAM}, {sigma _e}, {R_e^maj}) which describes the distribution of the galaxy population, where {M_JAM}≡ L× (M/L)_JAM≈ M_star. The distribution of galaxy properties on both projections of the MP is characterized by: (i) the same zone of exclusion (ZOE), which can be transformed from one projection to the other using the scalar virial equation. The ZOE is roughly described by two power laws, joined by a break at a characteristic mass {M_JAM}≈ 3× 10^{10} { M_{&sun;}}, which corresponds to the minimum Re and maximum stellar density. This results in a break in the mean {M_JAM}-{sigma _e} relation with trends {M_JAM}∝ sigma _e^{2.3} and {M_JAM}∝ sigma _e^{4.7} at small and large sigmae, respectively; (ii) a characteristic mass {M_JAM}≈ 2× 10^{11} { M_{&sun;}} which separates a population dominated by flat fast rotator with discs and spiral galaxies at lower masses, from one dominated by quite round slow rotators at larger masses; (iii) below that mass the distribution of ETGs' properties on the two projections of the MP tends to be constant along lines of roughly constant sigmae, or equivalently along lines with {R_e^maj}∝ {M_JAM}, respectively (or even better parallel to the ZOE: {R_e^maj}∝ M_JAM^{0.75}); (iv) it forms a continuous and parallel sequence with the distribution of spiral galaxies; (v) at even lower masses, the distribution of fast-rotator ETGs and late spirals naturally extends to that of dwarf ETGs (Sph) and dwarf irregulars (Im), respectively.  We use dynamical models to analyse our kinematic maps. We show that sigmae traces the bulge fraction, which appears to be the main driver for the observed trends in the dynamical (M/L)JAM and in indicators of the (M/L)pop of the stellar population like Hbeta and colour, as well as in the molecular gas fraction. A similar variation along contours of sigmae is also observed for the mass normalization of the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which was recently shown to vary systematically within the ETGs' population. Our preferred relation has the form log _{10} [(M/L)_stars/(M/L)_Salp]=a+b× log _{10}({sigma _e}/130 {km s^{-1}}) with a = -0.12 $\pm$ 0.01 and b = 0.35 $\pm$ 0.06. Unless there are major flaws in all stellar population models, this trend implies a transition of the mean IMF from Kroupa to Salpeter in the interval log _{10}({sigma _e}/{km s}^{-1})≈ 1.9-2.5 (or {sigma _e}≈ 90-290 km s-1), with a smooth variation in between, consistently with what was shown in Cappellari et al. The observed distribution of galaxy properties on the MP provides a clean and novel view for a number of previously reported trends, which constitute special two-dimensional projections of the more general four-dimensional parameters trends on the MP. We interpret it as due to a combination of two main effects: (i) an increase of the bulge fraction, which increases sigmae, decreases Re, and greatly enhance the likelihood for a galaxy to have its star formation quenched, and (ii) dry merging, increasing galaxy mass and Re by moving galaxies along lines of roughly constant sigmae (or steeper), while leaving the population nearly unchanged.},

	Abstract = {We construct axisymmetric and triaxial galaxy models with a phase-space distribution function that depends on linear combinations of the three exact integrals of motion for a separable potential. These Abel models, first introduced by Dejonghe & Laurent and subsequently extended by Mathieu & Dejonghe, are the axisymmetric and triaxial generalizations of the well-known spherical Osipkov-Merritt models. We show that the density and higher order velocity moments, as well as the line-of-sight velocity distribution of these models can be calculated efficiently and that they capture much of the rich internal dynamics of early-type galaxies. We build a triaxial and oblate axisymmetric galaxy model with projected kinematics that mimic the two-dimensional kinematic observations that are obtained with integral-field spectrographs such as SAURON. We fit the simulated observations with axisymmetric and triaxial dynamical models constructed with our numerical implementation of Schwarzschild orbit-superposition method. We find that Schwarzschild method is able to recover the internal dynamics and three-integral distribution function of realistic models of early-type galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the orbital distribution of elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies using SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics within about one effective (half-light) radius. We construct the anisotropy diagram, which relates the ratio of the ordered and random motion in a galaxy (V/sigma) to its observed ellipticity (ε), for the 48 E/S0 galaxies from the SAURON survey. For a subsample of 24 galaxies consistent with axisymmetry, we use three-integral axisymmetric Schwarzschild dynamical models to recover the detailed orbital distribution, and we find good agreement with the anisotropy derived from the (V/sigma, ε) diagram. In a companion paper (Paper IX), we show that the early-type galaxies can be subdivided into two classes of systems with or without a significant amount of specific stellar angular momentum. Here, we show that the two classes have different distributions on the (V/sigma, ε) diagram. The slow rotators are more common among the most massive systems and are generally classified as E from photometry alone. Those in our sample tend to be fairly round (ε <~ 0.3), but can have significant kinematical misalignments, indicating that as a class they are moderately triaxial, and span a range of anisotropies (delta <~ 0.3). The fast rotators are generally fainter and are classified as either E or S0. They can appear quite flattened (ε <~ 0.7), do not show significant kinematical misalignments (unless barred or interacting), indicating they are nearly axisymmetric and span an even larger range of anisotropies (delta <~ 0.5). These results are confirmed when we extend our analysis to 18 additional E/S0 galaxies observed with SAURON. The dynamical models indicate that the anisotropy inferred from the (V/sigma, ε) diagram is due to a flattening of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane (sigmaR > sigmaz), which we quantify with the beta anisotropy parameter. We find a trend of increasing beta for intrinsically flatter galaxies. A number of the fast rotators show evidence for containing a flattened, kinematically distinct component, which in some cases counter-rotates relative to the main galaxy body. These components are generally more metal rich than the galaxy body. All these results support the idea that fast rotators are nearly oblate and contain disc-like components. The role of gas must have been important for their formation. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial. Current collisionless merger models seem unable to explain their detailed observed properties.},

@article{Chabrier03,
	Abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m>~1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc~0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass sigma~0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc~0.2 Msolar and sigma~0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD~n*~0.1 pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages >~130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc~0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below ~1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

	Abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is a key parameter for studying galaxy evolution. Here we measure the IMF mass normalization for a sample of 68 field galaxies in the redshift range 0.7-0.9 within the Extended Groth Strip. To do this we derive the total (stellar + dark matter) mass-to-light [(M/L)] ratio using axisymmetric dynamical models. Within the region where we have kinematics (about one half-light radius), the models assume (1) that mass follows light, implying negligible differences between the slope of the stellar and total density profiles, (2) constant velocity anisotropy (\beta _{z}\equiv 1-\sigma _z^2/\sigma _R^2=0.2), and (3) that galaxies are seen at the average inclination for random orientations (i.e., i = 60$\,^{\circ}$, where i = 90$\,^{\circ}$ represents edge-on). The dynamical models are based on anisotropic Jeans equations, constrained by Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging and the central velocity dispersion of the galaxies, extracted from good-quality spectra taken by the DEEP2 survey. The population (M/L) are derived from full-spectrum fitting of the same spectra with a grid of simple stellar population models. Recent dynamical modeling results from the ATLAS3D project and numerical simulations of galaxy evolution indicate that the dark matter fraction within the central regions of our galaxies should be small. This suggests that our derived total (M/L) should closely approximate the stellar M/L. Our comparison of the dynamical (M/L) and the population (M/L) then implies that for galaxies with stellar mass M * >~ 1011 M ☉, the average normalization of the IMF is consistent with a Salpeter slope, with a substantial scatter. This is similar to what is found within a similar mass range for nearby galaxies.},

@article{Ness13a,
	Abstract = {We present the metallicity results from the ARGOS spectroscopic survey of the Galactic bulge. Our aim is to understand the formation of the Galactic bulge: did it form via mergers, as expected from Lambda cold dark matter theory, or from disc instabilities, as suggested by its boxy/peanut shape, or both? Our stars are mostly red clump giants, which have a well-defined absolute magnitude from which distances can be determined. We have obtained spectra for 28 000 stars at a spectral resolution of R = 11 000. From these spectra, we have determined stellar parameters and distances to an accuracy of <1.5 kpc. The stars in the inner Galaxy span a large range in [Fe/H], -2.8 <= [Fe/H] <= +0.6. From the spatial distribution of the red clump stars as a function of [Fe/H], we propose that the stars with [Fe/H] > -0.5 are part of the boxy/peanut bar/bulge. We associate the lower metallicity stars ([Fe/H] < -0.5) with the thick disc, which may be puffed up in the inner region, and with the inner regions of the metal-weak thick disc and inner halo. For the bulge stars with [Fe/H] > -0.5, we find two discrete populations: (i) stars with [Fe/H] ≈ -0.25 which provide a roughly constant fraction of the stars in the latitude interval b = -5$\,^{\circ}$ to -10$\,^{\circ}$, and (ii) a kinematically colder, more metal-rich population with mean [Fe/H] ≈ +0.15 which is more prominent closer to the plane. The changing ratio of these components with latitude appears as a vertical abundance gradient of the bulge. We attribute both of these bulge components to instability-driven bar/bulge formation from the thin disc. We associate the thicker component with the stars of the early less metal-rich thin disc, and associate the more metal-rich population concentrated to the plane with the colder more metal-rich stars of the early thin disc, similar to the colder and younger more metal-rich stars seen in the thin disc in the solar neighbourhood today. We do not exclude a weak underlying classical merger-generated bulge component, but see no obvious kinematic association of any of our bulge stars with such a classical bulge component. The clear spatial and kinematic separation of the two bulge populations (i) and (ii) makes it unlikely that any significant merger event could have affected the inner regions of the Galaxy since the time when the bulge-forming instabilities occurred.},

	Abstract = {Near the minor axis of the Galactic bulge, at latitudes b < -5$\,^{\circ}$, the red giant clump stars are split into two components along the line of sight. We investigate this split using the three fields from the ARGOS survey that lie on the minor axis at (l, b) = (0$\,^{\circ}$, -5$\,^{\circ}$), (0$\,^{\circ}$, -7fdg5), (0$\,^{\circ}$, -10$\,^{\circ}$). The separation is evident for stars with [Fe/H] > - 0.5 in the two higher-latitude fields, but not in the field at b = -5$\,^{\circ}$. Stars with [Fe/H] < - 0.5 do not show the split. We compare the spatial distribution and kinematics of the clump stars with predictions from an evolutionary N-body model of a bulge that grew from a disk via bar-related instabilities. The density distribution of the peanut-shaped model is depressed near its minor axis. This produces a bimodal distribution of stars along the line of sight through the bulge near its minor axis, very much as seen in our observations. The observed and modeled kinematics of the two groups of stars are also similar. We conclude that the split red clump of the bulge is probably a generic feature of boxy/peanut bulges that grew from disks, and that the disk from which the bulge grew had relatively few stars with [Fe/H] < - 0.5.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the Making Galaxies In a Cosmological Context (MAGICC) programme of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. We describe a parameter study of galaxy formation simulations of an L* galaxy that uses early stellar feedback combined with supernova feedback to match the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. While supernova feedback alone can reduce star formation enough to match the stellar mass-halo mass relationship, the galaxy forms too many stars before z = 2 to match the evolution seen using abundance matching. Our early stellar feedback is purely thermal and thus operates like an ultraviolet ionization source as well as providing some additional pressure from the radiation of massive, young stars. The early feedback heats gas to >106 K before cooling it to 104 K. The pressure from this hot gas creates a more extended disc and prevents more star formation prior to z = 1 than supernova feedback alone. The resulting disc galaxy has a flat rotation curve, an exponential surface brightness profile, and matches a wide range of disc scaling relationships. The disc forms from the inside-out with an increasing exponential scale length as the galaxy evolves. Overall, early stellar feedback helps to simulate galaxies that match observational results at low and high redshifts.},

	Abstract = {We analyze and compare the bulges of a sample of L * spiral galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations in a cosmological context, using two different codes, P-DEVA and GASOLINE. The codes regulate star formation in very different ways, with P-DEVA simulations inputting low star formation efficiency under the assumption that feedback occurs on subgrid scales, while the GASOLINE simulations have feedback that drives large-scale outflows. In all cases, the marked knee shape in mass aggregation tracks, corresponding to the transition from an early phase of rapid mass assembly to a later slower one, separates the properties of two populations within the simulated bulges. The bulges analyzed show an important early starburst resulting from the collapse-like fast phase of mass assembly, followed by a second phase with lower star formation, driven by a variety of processes such as disk instabilities and/or mergers. Classifying bulge stellar particles identified at z = 0 into old and young according to these two phases, we found bulge stellar sub-populations with distinct kinematics, shapes, stellar ages, and metal contents. The young components are more oblate, generally smaller, more rotationally supported, with higher metallicity and less alpha-element enhanced than the old ones. These results are consistent with the current observational status of bulges, and provide an explanation for some apparently paradoxical observations, such as bulge rejuvenation and metal-content gradients observed. Our results suggest that bulges of L * galaxies will generically have two bulge populations that can be likened to classical and pseudo-bulges, with differences being in the relative proportions of the two, which may vary due to galaxy mass and specific mass accretion and merger histories.},

	Abstract = {Within a fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we form a galaxy which rotates at 140 km s-1, and it is characterized by two loose spiral arms and a bar, indicative of a Hubble-type SBc/d galaxy. We show that our simulated galaxy has no classical bulge, with a pure disc profile at z = 1, well after the major merging activity has ended. A long-lived bar subsequently forms, resulting in the formation of a secularly formed 'pseudo-'bulge, with the final bulge-to-total light ratio of 0.21. We show that the majority of gas which loses angular momentum and falls to the central region of the galaxy during the merging epoch is blown back into the hot halo, with much of it returning later to form stars in the disc. We propose that this mechanism of redistribution of angular momentum via a galactic fountain, when coupled with the results from our previous study which showed why gas outflows are biased to have low angular momentum, can solve the angular momentum/bulgeless disc problem of the cold dark matter paradigm.},

	Abstract = {Recent data from the VVV survey have strengthened evidence for a structural change in the Galactic bulge inward of |l| <= 4$\,^{\circ}$. Here we show with an N-body barred galaxy simulation that a boxy bulge formed through the bar and buckling instabilities effortlessly matches measured bulge longitude profiles for red clump stars. The same simulation snapshot was earlier used to clarify the apparent boxy bulge---long bar dichotomy, for the same orientation and scaling. The change in the slope of the model longitude profiles in the inner few degrees is caused by a transition from highly elongated to more nearly axisymmetric isodensity contours in the inner boxy bulge. This transition is confined to a few degrees from the Galactic plane; thus the change of slope is predicted to disappear at higher Galactic latitudes. We also show that the nuclear star count map derived from this simulation snapshot displays a longitudinal asymmetry similar to that observed in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) data, but is less flattened to the Galactic plane than the 2MASS map. These results support the interpretation that the Galactic bulge originated from disk evolution and question the evidence advanced from star count data for the existence of a secondary nuclear bar in the Milky Way.},

@article{Saha12,
	Abstract = {Secular evolution is one of the key routes through which galaxies evolve along the Hubble sequence. Not only does the disc undergo morphological and kinematic changes, but a pre-existing classical bulge may also be dynamically changed by the secular processes driven primarily by the bar. We study the influence of a growing bar on the dynamical evolution of a low-mass classical bulge that might be present in galaxies like the Milky Way. Using self-consistent high-resolution N-body simulations, we study how an initially isotropic non-rotating small classical bulge absorbs angular momentum emitted by the bar. The basic mechanism of this angular momentum exchange is through resonances and a considerable fraction of the angular momentum is channelled through Lagrange point (-1:1) and inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) (2:1) orbits. In the phase of rapid dynamical growth, retrograde non-resonant orbits also absorb significant angular momentum. As a result of this angular momentum gain, the initially non-rotating classical bulge transforms into a fast rotating, radially anisotropic and triaxial object, embedded in the similarly fast rotating boxy bulge formed from the disc. Towards the end of the evolution, the classical bulge develops cylindrical rotation. By that time, its inner regions host a 'classical bulge-bar' whose distinct kinematics could serve as direct observational evidence for the secular evolution in the galaxy. Implications of these results are discussed in brief.},

@article{Shen10,
	Abstract = {Bulges are commonly believed to form in the dynamical violence of galaxy collisions and mergers. Here, we model the stellar kinematics of the Bulge Radial Velocity Assay (BRAVA) and find no sign that the Milky Way contains a classical bulge formed by scrambling pre-existing disks of stars in major mergers. Rather, the bulge appears to be a bar seen somewhat end-on, as hinted from its asymmetric boxy shape. We construct a simple but realistic N-body model of the Galaxy that self-consistently develops a bar. The bar immediately buckles and thickens in the vertical direction. As seen from the Sun, the result resembles the boxy bulge of our Galaxy. The model fits the BRAVA stellar kinematic data covering the whole bulge strikingly well with no need for a merger-made classical bulge. The bar in our best-fit model has a half-length of ~4 kpc and extends 20$\,^{\circ}$ from the Sun-Galactic center line. We use the new kinematic constraints to show that any classical bulge contribution cannot be larger than ~8% of the disk mass. Thus, the Galactic bulge is a part of the disk and not a separate component made in a prior merger. Giant, pure-disk galaxies like our own present a major challenge to the standard picture in which galaxy formation is dominated by hierarchical clustering and galaxy mergers.},

	Abstract = {The color-magnitude diagrams of ~7 x 105 stars obtained for 12 fields across the Galactic bulge with the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment project reveal a well-defined population of bulge red clump giants. We find that the distributions of the apparent magnitudes of the red clump stars are systematically fainter when observing toward lower Galactic l fields. The most plausible explanation for this distinct trend is that the Galactic bulge is a bar whose nearest end lies at positive Galactic longitude. We model this Galactic bar by fitting the observed luminosity functions in the red clump region of the color-magnitude diagram for all fields. We find that, almost regardless of the analytical function used to describe the three-dimensional distribution of stars in the Galactic bar, the resulting models have the major axis inclined to the line of sight from 20 deg to 30 deg, with axis ratios corresponding to x0:y0:z0 = 3.5:1.5:1. This puts a strong constraint on the possible range of the Galactic bar models.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We determine the iron distribution function (IDF) for bulge field stars, in three different fields along the Galactic minor axis and at latitudes b = -4$\,^{\circ}$, b = -6$\,^{\circ}$, and b = -12$\,^{\circ}$. A fourth field including NGC 6553 is also included in the discussion.  Methods: About 800 bulge field K giants were observed with the GIRAFFE spectrograph of FLAMES@VLT at spectral resolution R ~ 20 000. Several of them were observed again with UVES at R ~ 45 000 to insure the accuracy of the measurements. The LTE abundance analysis yielded stellar parameters and iron abundances that allowed us to construct an IDF for the bulge that, for the first time, is based on high-resolution spectroscopy for each individual star.  Results: The IDF derived here is centered on solar metallicity, and extends from [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 to [Fe/H] ~ +0.5. The distribution is asymmetric, with a sharper cutoff on the high-metallicity side, and it is narrower than previously measured. A variation in the mean metallicity along the bulge minor axis is clearly between b = -4$\,^{\circ}$ and b = -6$\,^{\circ}$ ([Fe/H] decreasing ~ by 0.6 dex per kpc). The field at b = -12$\,^{\circ}$ is consistent with the presence of a gradient, but its quantification is complicated by the higher disk/bulge fraction in this field.  Conclusions: Our findings support a scenario in which both infall and outflow were important during the bulge formation, and then suggest the presence of a radial gradient, which poses some challenges to the scenario in which the bulge would result solely from the vertical heating of the bar.  Observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile (ESO programmes 71.B-0617 and 73.B-0074).

	Abstract = {Context. The Galactic bulge is a massive, old component of the Milky Way. It is known to host a bar, and it has recently been demonstrated to have a pronounced boxy/peanut structure in its outer region. Several independent studies suggest the presence of more than one stellar populations in the bulge, with different origins and a relative fraction changing across the bulge area.  Aims: This is the first of a series of papers presenting the results of the Giraffe Inner Bulge Survey, carried out at the ESO-VLT with the multifibre spectrograph FLAMES. Spectra of ~5000 red clump giants in 24 bulge fields have been obtained at resolution R = 6500, in the infrared Calcium triplet wavelength region at ~8500 {\AA}. They are used to derive radial velocities and metallicities, based on new calibration specifically devised for this project. Radial velocities for another ~1200 bulge red clump giants, obtained from similar archive data, have been added to the sample. Higher resolution spectra have been obtained for ~450 additional stars at latitude b = -3.5, with the aim of investigating chemical abundance patterns variations with longitude, across the inner bulge. In total we present here radial velocities for 6392 red clump stars.  Methods: We present here the target selection criteria, observing strategy and the catalog with radial velocity measurements for all the target stars.  Results: We derive a radial velocity, and velocity dispersion map of the Milky Way bulge, useful to be compared with similar maps of external bulges, and to infer the expected velocities and dispersion at any line of sight. The K-type giants kinematics is consistent with the cylindrical rotation pattern of M-giants from the BRAVA survey. Our sample enables to extend this result to latitude b = -2, closer to the Galactic plane than probed by previous surveys. Finally, we find strong evidence for a velocity dispersion peak at (0, -1) and (0, -2), possibily indicative of a high density peak in the central ~250 pc of the bulge.  Based on observations taken with ESO telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under program IDs 187.B-909 and 089.B-0830.Full Table 2 is available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/562/A66},

@article{Ness13,
	Abstract = {We present the kinematic results from our ARGOS spectroscopic survey of the Galactic bulge of the Milky Way. Our aim is to understand the formation of the Galactic bulge. We examine the kinematics of about 17 400 stars in the bulge located within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic Centre, identified from the 28 000 star ARGOS survey. We aim to determine if the formation of the bulge has been internally driven from disc instabilities as suggested by its boxy shape, or if mergers have played a significant role as expected from lambda cold dark matter simulations. From our velocity measurements across latitudes b = -5$\,^{\circ}$, - 7.5$\,^{\circ}$ and -10$\,^{\circ}$ we find the bulge to be a cylindrically rotating system that transitions smoothly out into the disc. From observations of 3 fields at b = +10, the kinematics of the bulge show North-South symmetry about the major axis. Within the bulge, we find a kinematically distinct metal-poor population ([Fe/H] < -1.0) that is not rotating cylindrically. The 5 per cent of our stars with [Fe/H] < -1.0 are a slowly rotating spheroidal population, which we believe are stars of the metal-weak thick disc and halo which presently lie in the inner Galaxy. The kinematics of the two bulge components that we identified in ARGOS Paper III (mean [Fe/H] ≈ -0.25 and [Fe/H] ≈ +0.15, respectively) demonstrate that they are likely to share a common formation origin and are distinct from the more metal-poor populations of the thick disc and halo which are co-located inside the bulge. We do not exclude an underlying merger generated bulge component but our results favour bulge formation from instabilities in the early thin disc.},

@article{Cappellari08,
	Abstract = {We present a simple and efficient anisotropic generalization of the semi-isotropic (two-integral) axisymmetric Jeans formalism, which is used to model the stellar kinematics of galaxies. The following is assumed: (i) a constant mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and (ii) a velocity ellipsoid that is aligned with cylindrical coordinates (R, z) and characterized by the classic anisotropy parameter . Our simple models are fit to SAURON integral-field observations of the stellar kinematics for a set of fast-rotator early-type galaxies. With only two free parameters (betaz and the inclination), the models generally provide remarkably good descriptions of the shape of the first (V) and second () velocity moments, once a detailed description of the surface brightness is given. This is consistent with previous findings on the dynamical structure of these objects. With the observationally motivated assumption that betaz >~ 0, the method is able to recover the inclination. The technique can be used to determine the dynamical M/L and angular momenta of early-type fast-rotators and spiral galaxies, especially when the quality of the data does not justify more sophisticated modelling approaches. This formalism allows for the inclusion of dark matter, supermassive black holes, spatially varying anisotropy and multiple kinematic components.},

@article{Conroy13,
	Abstract = {Several independent lines of evidence suggest that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in early-type galaxies becomes increasingly "bottom-heavy" with increasing galaxy mass and/or velocity dispersion, sigma. Here we consider evidence for IMF variation in a sample of relatively compact early-type galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These galaxies are of sufficiently high stellar density that a dark halo likely makes a minor contribution to the total dynamical mass, M dyn, within one effective radius. We fit our detailed stellar population synthesis models to the stacked absorption line spectra of these galaxies in bins of sigma and find evidence from IMF-sensitive spectral features for a bottom-heavy IMF at high sigma. We also apply simple "mass-follows-light" dynamical models to the same data and find that M dyn is significantly higher than what would be expected if these galaxies were stellar dominated and had a universal Milky Way IMF. Adopting M dyn ≈ M * therefore implies that the IMF is "heavier" at high sigma. Most importantly, the quantitative amount of inferred IMF variation is very similar between the two techniques, agreeing to within <~ 0.1 dex in mass. The agreement between two independent techniques, when applied to the same data, provides compelling evidence for systematic variation in the IMF as a function of early-type galaxy velocity dispersion. Any alternative explanations must reproduce both the results from dynamical and stellar population-based techniques.},

	Abstract = {We present constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in two ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, Hercules and Leo IV, based on deep Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging. The Hercules and Leo IV galaxies are extremely low luminosity (MV = -6.2, -5.5), metal-poor (lang[Fe/H]rang = -2.4, -2.5) systems that have old stellar populations (>11 Gyr). Because they have long relaxation times, we can directly measure the low-mass stellar IMF by counting stars below the main-sequence turnoff without correcting for dynamical evolution. Over the stellar mass range probed by our data, 0.52-0.77 M &sun;, the IMF is best fit by a power-law slope of \alpha = 1.2_{-0.5}^{+0.4} for Hercules and alpha = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.8 for Leo IV. For Hercules, the IMF slope is more shallow than a Salpeter (alpha = 2.35) IMF at the 5.8sigma level, and a Kroupa (alpha = 2.3 above 0.5 M &sun;) IMF slope at 5.4sigma level. We simultaneously fit for the binary fraction, f binary, finding f_binary = 0.47^{+0.16}_{-0.14} for Hercules, and 0.47^{+0.37}_{-0.17} for Leo IV. The UFD binary fractions are consistent with that inferred for Milky Way stars in the same mass range, despite very different metallicities. In contrast, the IMF slopes in the UFDs are shallower than other galactic environments. In the mass range 0.5-0.8 M &sun;, we see a trend across the handful of galaxies with directly measured IMFs such that the power-law slopes become shallower (more bottom-light) with decreasing galactic velocity dispersion and metallicity. This trend is qualitatively consistent with results in elliptical galaxies inferred via indirect methods and is direct evidence for IMF variations with galactic environment.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at STScI, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

@article{Bell01,
	Abstract = {We have used a suite of simplified spectrophotometric spiral galaxy evolution models to argue that there are substantial variations in stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios within and among galaxies, amounting to factors of between 3 and 7 in the optical and factors of 2 in the near-infrared. Our models show a strong correlation between stellar M/L and the optical colors of the integrated stellar populations. Under the assumption of a universal spiral galaxy initial mass function (IMF), relative trends in model stellar M/L with color are robust to uncertainties in stellar population and galaxy evolution modeling, including the effects of modest bursts of star formation. Errors in the dust-reddening estimates do not strongly affect the final derived stellar masses of a stellar population. We examine the observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios of a sample of spiral galaxies with accurate rotation curves and optical and near-infrared luminosity profiles. From these observed maximum disk M/L ratios we conclude that a Salpeter IMF has too many low-mass stars per unit luminosity but that an IMF similar to the Salpeter IMF at the high-mass end with less low-mass stars (giving stellar M/L ratios 30% lower than the Salpeter value) is consistent with the maximum disk constraints. Trends in observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios with color provide a good match to the predicted model relation, suggesting that the spiral galaxy stellar IMF is universal and that a fraction of (particularly high surface brightness) spiral galaxies may be close to maximum disk. We apply the model trends in stellar M/L ratio with color to the Tully-Fisher (T-F) relation. We find that the stellar mass T-F relation is relatively steep, has modest scatter, and is independent of the passband and color used to derive the stellar masses, again lending support for a universal IMF. The difference in slope between the optical (especially blue) and near-infrared T-F relations is due to the combined effects of dust attenuation and stellar M/L variations with galaxy mass. Assuming the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project distance to the Ursa Major Cluster and neglecting the (uncertain) molecular gas fraction, we find that the baryonic T-F relation takes the form Mbaryon~V3.5 (with random and systematic 1 sigma slope errors of ~0.2 each) when using a bisector fit and rotation velocities derived from the flat part of the rotation curve. Since we have normalized the stellar M/L ratios to be as high as can possibly be allowed by maximum disk constraints, the slope of the baryonic T-F relation will be somewhat shallower than 3.5 if all disks are substantially submaximal.},

	Abstract = {We use the relations between aperture stellar velocity dispersion (sigmaap), stellar mass (MSPS) and galaxy size (Re) for a sample of ˜150 000 early-type galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey/DR7 to place constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and dark halo response to galaxy formation. We build lambda cold dark matter-based mass models that reproduce, by construction, the relations between galaxy size, light concentration and stellar mass, and use the spherical Jeans equations to predict sigmaap. Given our model assumptions (including those in the stellar population synthesis models), we find that reproducing the median sigmaap versus MSPS relation is not possible with both a universal IMF and a universal dark halo response. Significant departures from a universal IMF and/or dark halo response are required, but there is a degeneracy between these two solutions. We show that this degeneracy can be broken using the strength of the correlation between residuals of the velocity-mass (Deltalog sigmaap) and size-mass (Deltalog Re) relations. The slope of this correlation, ∂VR ≡ Deltalog sigmaap/Deltalog Re, varies systematically with galaxy mass from ∂VR ~= -0.45 at MSPS ˜ 1010 M&sun; to ∂VR ~= -0.15 at MSPS ˜ 1011.6 M&sun;. The virial Fundamental Plane (FP) has ∂VR = -1/2, and thus we find that the tilt of the observed FP is mass dependent. Reproducing this tilt requires both a non-universal IMF and a non-universal halo response. Our best model has mass-follows-light at low masses (MSPS ≲ 1011.2 M&sun;) and unmodified Navarro, Frenk and White haloes at MSPS ˜ 1011.5 M&sun;. The stellar masses imply a mass-dependent IMF which is `lighter' than Salpeter at low masses and `heavier' than Salpeter at high masses.},

	Abstract = {We study the mass and anisotropy distribution of the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 5846 using stars, as well as the red and blue globular cluster (GC) subpopulations. We break degeneracies in the dynamical models by taking advantage of the different phase space distributions of the two GC subpopulations to unambiguously constrain the mass of the galaxy and the anisotropy of the GC system. Red GCs show the same spatial distribution and behaviour as the starlight, whereas blue GCs have a shallower density profile, a larger velocity dispersion and a lower kurtosis, all of which suggest a different orbital distribution. We use a dispersion-kurtosis Jeans analysis and find that the solutions of separate analyses for the two GC subpopulations overlap in the halo parameter space. The solution converges on a massive dark matter halo, consistent with expectations from Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) and 7-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7) cosmology in terms of virial mass (log MDM ˜ 13.3 M&sun;) and concentration (cvir ˜ 8). This is the first such analysis that solves the dynamics of the different GC subpopulations in a self-consistent manner. Our method improves the uncertainties on the halo parameter determination by a factor of 2 and opens new avenues for the use of elliptical galaxy dynamics as tests of predictions from cosmological simulations. The implied stellar mass-to-light ratio derived from the dynamical modelling is fully consistent with a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) and rules out a bottom light IMF. The different GC subpopulations show markedly distinct orbital distributions at large radii, with red GCs having an anisotropy parameter beta˜0.4 outside ˜ 3 Re (Re is the effective radius), and the blue GCs having beta˜0.15 at the same radii, while centrally ( ˜ 1 Re) they are both isotropic. We discuss the implications of our findings within the two-phase formation scenario for early-type galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Whether the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is universal or is instead sensitive to environmental conditions is of critical importance: The IMF influences most observable properties of stellar populations and thus galaxies, and detecting variations in the IMF could provide deep insights into the star formation process. This review critically examines reports of IMF variations, with a view toward whether other explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the vast majority were drawn from a universal system IMF: a power law of Salpeter index (Gamma = 1.35) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower power law (Gamma ˜ 0-0.25) for lower mass stars. The shape and universality of the substellar IMF is still under investigation. Observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of most galaxies are also consistent with a universal IMF, suggesting no gross variations over much of cosmic time. Indications of ``nonstandard'' IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments clearly warrant further study. However, there is no clear evidence that the IMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions after the first few generations of stars.},

	Abstract = {A sample numerical model has been computed for a triaxial stellar system in dynamical equilibrium. A four-step procedure was employed. (1) A density distribution with a modified Hubble profile - to approximate elliptical galaxies - and axis ratios of 1:25:2 was chosen. This figure was further chosen not to rotate. (2) The potential corresponding to the chosen density distribution was computed. (3) About 1500 orbits were computed with this potential, one at a time, each covering typically 100 oscillations through the system; i.e., about 1 billion years. These orbits belong to two families, viz., box orbits and tube orbits around the long axis of the system. (4) A reproduction of the chosen density distribution - in terms of its mass in 285 cells in each octant - was sought by superposition of a subset of the available orbits, each populated by an appropriate nonnegative number of stars. The application of linear programming led to a numerical solution. The main results are: First, the majority of the orbits computed in step 3 turned out to have three effective integrals; i.e., two nonclassical ones in addition to the energy integral. Second, the existence of the numerical solution found in step 4 suggests the existence of triaxial self-consistent systems in dynamical equilibrium with density profiles fitting elliptical galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The ATLAS3D project is a multiwavelength survey combined with a theoretical modelling effort. The observations span from the radio to the millimetre and optical, and provide multicolour imaging, two-dimensional kinematics of the atomic (H I), molecular (CO) and ionized gas (Hbeta, [O III] and [N I]), together with the kinematics and population of the stars (Hbeta, Fe5015 and Mg b), for a carefully selected, volume-limited (1.16 × 105 Mpc3) sample of 260 early-type (elliptical E and lenticular S0) galaxies (ETGs). The models include semi-analytic, N-body binary mergers and cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Here we present the science goals for the project and introduce the galaxy sample and the selection criteria. The sample consists of nearby (D < 42 Mpc, |delta- 29$\,^{\circ}$| < 35$\,^{\circ}$, |b| > 15$\,^{\circ}$) morphologically selected ETGs extracted from a parent sample of 871 galaxies (8 per cent E, 22 per cent S0 and 70 per cent spirals) brighter than MK < -21.5 mag (stellar mass M*≳ 6 ×109 M&sun;). We analyse possible selection biases and we conclude that the parent sample is essentially complete and statistically representative of the nearby galaxy population. We present the size-luminosity relation for the spirals and ETGs and show that the ETGs in the ATLAS3D sample define a tight red sequence in a colour-magnitude diagram, with few objects in the transition from the blue cloud. We describe the strategy of the SAURON integral field observations and the extraction of the stellar kinematics with the pPXF method. We find typical 1sigma errors of DeltaV≈ 6 km s-1, Deltasigma≈ 7 km s-1, Deltah3≈Deltah4≈ 0.03 in the mean velocity, the velocity dispersion and Gauss-Hermite (GH) moments for galaxies with effective dispersion sigmae≳ 120 km s-1. For galaxies with lower sigmae (≈40 per cent of the sample) the GH moments are gradually penalized by pPXF towards zero to suppress the noise produced by the spectral undersampling and only V and sigma can be measured. We give an overview of the characteristics of the other main data sets already available for our sample and of the ongoing modelling projects.},

@article{Cappellari12,
	Abstract = {Much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emitted by their stars, which depends on the present number of each type of star in the galaxy. The present number depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which describes the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed, and knowledge of it is critical to almost every aspect of galaxy evolution. More than 50 years after the first IMF determination, no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal among different types of galaxies. Previous studies indicated that the IMF and the dark matter fraction in galaxy centres cannot both be universal, but they could not convincingly discriminate between the two possibilities. Only recently were indications found that massive elliptical galaxies may not have the same IMF as the Milky Way. Here we report a study of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the large representative ATLAS3D sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass, using detailed dynamical models. We find a strong systematic variation in IMF in early-type galaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratios, producing differences of a factor of up to three in galactic stellar mass. This implies that a galaxy's IMF depends intimately on the galaxy's formation history.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the well-known correlations between the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and other global observables of elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies. We construct two-integral Jeans and three-integral Schwarzschild dynamical models for a sample of 25 E/S0 galaxies with SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics to about one effective (half-light) radius Re. They have well-calibrated I-band Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 and large-field ground-based photometry, accurate surface brightness fluctuation distances, and their observed kinematics is consistent with an axisymmetric intrinsic shape. All these factors result in an unprecedented accuracy in the M/L measurements. We find a tight correlation of the form (M/L) = (3.80 +/- 0.14) × (sigmae/200kms-1)0.84+/-0.07 between the M/L (in the I band) measured from the dynamical models and the luminosity-weighted second moment sigmae of the LOSVD within Re. The observed rms scatter in M/L for our sample is 18 per cent, while the inferred intrinsic scatter is ~13 per cent. The (M/L)-sigmae relation can be included in the remarkable series of tight correlations between sigmae and other galaxy global observables. The comparison of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane (FP), and with simple virial estimates, shows that the `tilt' of the FP of early-type galaxies, describing the deviation of the FP from the virial relation, is almost exclusively due to a real M/L variation, while structural and orbital non-homology have a negligible effect. When the photometric parameters are determined in the `classic' way, using growth curves, and the sigmae is measured in a large aperture, the virial mass appears to be a reliable estimator of the mass in the central regions of galaxies, and can be safely used where more `expensive' models are not feasible (e.g. in high-redshift studies). In this case the best-fitting virial relation has the form (M/L)vir= (5.0 +/- 0.1) ×Resigma2e/(LG), in reasonable agreement with simple theoretical predictions. We find no difference between the M/L of the galaxies in clusters and in the field. The comparison of the dynamical M/L with the (M/L)pop inferred from the analysis of the stellar population, indicates a median dark matter fraction in early-type galaxies of ~30 per cent of the total mass inside one Re, in broad agreement with previous studies, and it also shows that the stellar initial mass function varies little among different galaxies. Our results suggest a variation in M/L at constant (M/L)pop, which seems to be linked to the galaxy dynamics. We speculate that fast-rotating galaxies have lower dark matter fractions than the slow-rotating and generally more-massive ones. If correct, this would suggest a connection between the galaxy assembly history and the dark matter halo structure. The tightness of our correlation provides some evidence against cuspy nuclear dark matter profiles in galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Galaxies with the mass of the Milky Way dominate the stellar mass density of the universe but it is uncertain how and when they were assembled. Here we study progenitors of these galaxies out to z = 2.5, using data from the 3D-HST and CANDELS Treasury surveys. We find that galaxies with present-day stellar masses of log (M) ≈ 10.7 built ~90% of their stellar mass since z = 2.5, with most of the star formation occurring before z = 1. In marked contrast to the assembly history of massive elliptical galaxies, mass growth is not limited to large radii: the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of 3.2^{+0.8}_{-0.7} between z = 2.5 and z = 1. We therefore rule out simple models in which bulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed around them. Instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks, through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. We find that after z = 1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continued to be built up, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z ~ 1 galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.},

@article{Schlegel98,
	Abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 mu m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 mu m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 mu m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 mu m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 mu m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 mu m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 mu m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 mu m (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 mu m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},
